      "title": "The First Light Curve Modeling and Orbital Period Change Investigation of Nine Contact Binaries around the Short-period Cutoff",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first light curve synthesis and orbital period change analysis of nine contact binaries around the short-period limit. It is found that all these systems are W-subtype contact binaries. One of them is a medium contact system while the others are shallow contact ones. Four of them manifest obvious O'Connell effect explained by a dark spot or hot spot on one of the component stars. Third light was detected in three systems. By investigating orbital period variations, we found that four of the targets display a secular period decrease while the others exhibit a long-term period increase. The secular period decrease is more likely caused by angular-momentum loss while the long-term period increase is due to mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. Based on the statistic of 19 ultrashort-period contact binaries with known orbital period changes, we found that seven of them display long-term decrease (three of them also exhibit cyclic variations), ten of them manifest long-term increase while two of them only show cyclic variation, and that most of them are shallow contact binaries supporting the long timescale angular-momentum loss theory suggested by Stepien. For the three deep contact systems, we found that they are probably triple systems. The tertiary companion plays an essential role during their formation and evolution."

      "title": "Optical Flares and a Long-lived Dark Spot on a Cool Shallow Contact Binary",
      "abstract": "W UMa-type stars are contact systems where both cool components fill the critical Roche lobes and share a common convective envelope. Long and unbroken time-series photometry is expected to play an important role in their origin and activity. The newly discovered short-period W UMa-type star, CSTAR 038663, was monitored continuously by Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) in Antarctica during the winters of 2008 and 2010. There were 15 optical flares recorded in the i band during the winter of 2010. This was the first time such flares were detected from a W UMa-type star. By analyzing the nearly unbroken photometric data from 2008, it is discovered that CSTAR 038663 is a W-type shallow contact binary system (f = 10.6(± 2.9)%) with a high mass ratio of q = 1.12(± 0.01), where the less massive component is slightly hotter than the more massive one. The asymmetric light curves are explained by the presence of a dark spot on the more massive component. Its temperature is about 800 K lower than the stellar photosphere and it covers 2.1% of the total photospheric surface. The lifetime of the dark spot is longer than 116 days. Using 725 eclipse times, we found that the observed-calculated (O-C) curve may show a cyclic variation that is explained by the presence of a close-in third body. Both the shallow contact configuration and the extremely high mass ratio suggest that CSTAR 038663 is presently evolving into a contact system with little mass transfer. The formation and evolution is driven by the loss of angular momentum via magnetic braking, and the close-in companion star is expected to play an important role, removing angular momentum from the central eclipsing binary."

      "title": "Contact binaries at the short period cut-off - I. Statistics and the first photometric investigations of 10 totally eclipsing systems",
      "abstract": "The period distribution of contact binaries exhibits a very sharp short period cut-off at 0.22 d. In order to provide valuable information on this short period limit, we observed 10 totally eclipsing contact binaries with orbital periods near this cut-off. By detailed analysis using the W-D code, we determined that two of these systems are A-subtype contact binaries while the others are W-subtype contact binaries and all the targets show shallow contact configurations. Half of the targets exhibit stellar spot activity and four of them have third light. A statistical work on well-studied ultrashort period contact binaries (USPCBs) was carried out, and physical parameters of 55 USPCBs were obtained. Some common properties for these systems were derived. Due to the study of the period-colour diagram of USPCBs, we found that the period-colour relation of USPCBs is different from other W UMa type contact binaries and USPCBs are metal-poor old stars. In addition, the evolutionary states of these systems were discussed by constructing the colour-density diagram. We derived that the evolutionary states of the two components of USPCBs show identical characteristics of other contact binaries despite a slower evolutionary status caused by smaller mass. We suggested that both the fully convective limit claimed by Rucinski and the angular momentum loss theory recommended by Stepien can produce the short period cut-off and a tertiary companion is very important during the formation of the short period contact binaries by removing angular momentum from the host eclipsing pairs under certain circumstances."

      "abstract": "The paper presents new geometric, photometric and absolute parameters, derived from combined spectroscopic and photometric solutions, for ten contact binary systems. The analysis shows that three systems (EF Boo, GM Dra and SW Lac) are of W-type with shallow to moderate contact. Seven systems (V417 Aql, AH Aur, YY CrB, UX Eri, DZ Psc, GR Vir and NN Vir) are of A-type in a deep contact configuration. For six systems (V417 Aql, YY CrB, GM Dra, UX Eri, SW Lac and GR Vir) a spot model is introduced to explain the O'Connell effect in their light curves. The photometric and geometric elements of the systems are combined with the spectroscopic data taken at David Dunlap Observatory to yield the absolute parameters of the components."

      "abstract": "We analyze new, high quality multicolor light curves of four overcontact binaries: AK Her, HI Dra, V1128 Tau, and V2612 Oph, and determine their orbital and physical parameters using the modeling program of G. Djurasevic and recently published results of radial velocity studies. The achieved precision in absolute masses is between 10% and 20%, and the precision in absolute radii is between 5% and 10%. All four systems are W UMa-type binaries with bright or dark spots indicative of mass and energy transfer or surface activity. We estimate the distances and the ages of the systems using the luminosities computed through our analysis, and perform an O - C study for V1128 Tau, which reveals a complex period variation that can be interpreted in terms of mass loss/exchange and either the presence of the third body, or the magnetic activity on one of the components. We conclude that further observations of these systems are needed to deepen our understanding of their nature and variability."

      "title": "AD Cancri: A Shallow Contact Solar-Type Eclipsing Binary and Evidence for a Dwarf Third Component and a 16 Year Magnetic Cycle",
      "abstract": "CCD photometric observations of AD Cancri obtained from 2000 March 7 to 2004 December 20 are presented. Variations of the light levels at the primary minimum and both maxima are found. Uniform solutions of four sets of photometric data were derived by using the Wilson-Devinney method. The solutions suggest that AD Cancri is a shallow W-type contact binary (f=8.3%+/-1.3%) with a high mass ratio of 1/q=0.770+/-0.002. The long-term variation of the light curve is explained by variable dark-spot models of the more massive component star with a possible 17 yr cycle. Our 13 times of light minimum over 5 years, including others collected from the literature, have been used for the period study. The complex period changes can be sorted into a long-term period increase at rate of dP/dt=+(4.94+/-0.16)×10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a 16.2 yr periodic component (A<SUB>3</SUB>=0.0155 days), and a very small amplitude period oscillation (A<SUB>4</SUB>=0.0051 days, P<SUB>4</SUB>=6.6 yr). The existence of third light may indicate that there is a tertiary component in the binary system. Solving the four-band light curves of Samec &amp; Bookmyer, it is found that the contribution of the tertiary component to the total light of the triple system increases with wavelength, which suggests that it is very cool and may be a very red main-sequence star. The small-amplitude period oscillation may be caused by the light-time effect of the cool tertiary component (M<SUB>3</SUB>~0.41 M<SUB>solar</SUB>). The 16.2 yr periodic component in the orbital period and the 17 yr cyclic activity of the dark spot on the more massive component both may reveal that the more massive component displays solar-type magnetic activity with a cycle length of about 16 yr."

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present new CCD photometric observations of AH Tauri in the R band observed in 2006 at the Yunnan Observatory. Two new times of light minima were derived from these observations. We modeled the light curves using the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney program. The results show that the variations of the light curves can be expained by a cool spot on the primary star. The fill-out factor is about 6.6%, indicating that AH Tauri is a shallow-contact system. The mass ratio was determined to be about 0.505. In addition, the orbital period variations of AH Tauri were investigated based on all of the photoelectric and CCD light minimum times, including our two new data. It was found that the orbital period exhibits a possible periodic variation with a period of {P}<SUB>{mod</SUB>}=54.62\\(+/- 0.20) years and a secular period decrease of {dP}/{dt}=-(1.823+/- 0.215)× {10}<SUP>-7</SUP> {days} {{yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP>. Since AH Tauri is an overcontact solar-like system, we discuss three mechanisms of the mass transfer, the light-time effect of the third body, and magnetic activity responsible for the orbital period changes."

      "title": "O'Connell effect in early-type contact binaries: du Boo and AG Vir",
      "abstract": "The paper presents new photoelectric observations of the eclipsing binary systems DU Boo and AG Vir. The systems are somewhat similar - both are A-type contact binaries with the maximum following the primary minimum being the brighter one. This light curve asymmetry is extremely temporally stable. The phase dependence of the color indices is unexpectedly small for the observed amplitude of the O'Connell effect, amounting to about 0.1 mag in the optical wavelength range which indicates a very large heated area with a temperature contrast of {Δ T ≈} 1000-1500 K. The broadening functions (BFs) of the systems do not show any dark solar-type photospheric spots. On the other hand, there are significant differences of BFs between the quadratures (surprisingly similar in both systems) indicative of stream of matter or bright region causing additional emission seen between the components around the phase 0.25. Absolute parameters of the components slightly depend on the adopted model. Long orbital period of both contact binaries combined with late spectral type indicate that the primary components of either of the systems (but particularly in case of DU Boo) already evolved off the main sequence. <P />Based on spectroscopic data from the David Dunlap Observatory, University of Toronto"

      "abstract": "In this paper, CCD photometric light curves for the short-period eclipsing binary 1SWASP J140533.33+114639.1 (hereafter J1405) in the BV R bands are presented and analyzed using the 2013 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. It is discovered that J1405 is a W-subtype shallow contact binary with a contact degree of f = 7.9 ± 0.5% and a mass ratio of q = 1.55 ± 0.02. In order to explain the asymmetric light curves of the system, a cool starspot on the more massive component is employed. This shallow contact eclipsing binary may have been formed from a short-period detached system through orbital shrinkage due to angular momentum loss. Based on the (O - C) method, the variation of orbital period is studied using all the available times of minimum light. The (O - C) diagram reveals that the period is increasing continuously at a rate of dP/dt = +2.09 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP>, d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one."

      "abstract": "We carried out photometric and low-resolution spectral observations of six eclipsing ultrashort-period binaries with main-sequence (MS)components. The light-curve solutions of the Rozhen observations show that all targets are overcontact systems. We found a well-defined empirical relation between period and semi-major axis for the short-period binaries and used it for estimation of the global parameters of the targets. Our results revealed that NSVS 925605 is quite an interesting target: (i) it is one of a few contact binaries with M components; (ii) it exhibits high activity (emission in the Hα line, X-ray emission, large cool spots, non-Planck energy distribution); (iii) its components differ in temperature by 700 K. All the appearances of high magnetic activity and the huge fill-out factor (0.7) of NSVS 925605 may be a precursor of the predicted merging of close magnetic binaries. Another unusual binary is NSVS 2700153, which reveals considerable long-term variability."

      "abstract": "Our discovery of 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5 as a probable doubly eclipsing quadruple system, containing a contact binary with P ~ 0.23 d and a detached binary with P ~ 1.31 d, was announced in 2013. Subsequently, Koo and collaborators confirmed the detached binary spectroscopically, and identified a fifth set of static spectral lines at its location, corresponding to an additional non-eclipsing component of the system. Here we present new spectroscopic and photometric observations, allowing confirmation of the contact binary and improved modelling of all four eclipsing components. The detached binary is found to contain components of masses 0.837 ± 0.008 and 0.674 ± 0.007M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with radii of 0.832 ± 0.018 and 0.669 ± 0.018R<SUB>⊙</SUB> and effective temperatures of and K, respectively; the contact system has masses 0.86 ± 0.02 and 0.341 ± 0.011M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, radii of 0.79 ± 0.04 and 0.52 ± 0.05R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, and a common effective temperature of 4700 ± 50 K. The fifth star is of similar temperature and spectral type to the primaries in the two binaries. Long-term photometric observations indicate the presence of a spot on one component of the detached binary, moving at an apparent rate of approximately one rotation every two years. Both binaries have consistent system velocities around -11 to -12 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which match the average radial velocity of the fifth star; consistent distance estimates for both subsystems of d = 78 ± 3 and d = 73 ± 4 pc are also found, and, with some further assumptions, of d = 83 ± 9 pc for the fifth star. These findings strongly support the claim that both binaries - and very probably all five stars - are gravitationally bound in a single system. The consistent angles of inclination found for the two binaries (88.2 ± 0.3°and 86 ± 4°) may also indicate that they originally formed by fragmentation (around 9-10 Gyr ago) from a single protostellar disk, and subsequently remained in the same orbital plane. <P />Table 1 is available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525973/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>"

      "abstract": "Photometric observations of AH Cnc, a W UMa-type system in the open cluster M67, were carried out by using the 50BiN telescope. About 100 h of time-series B- and V -band data were taken, based on which eight new times of light minima were determined. By applying the Wilson-Devinney method, the light curves were modeled and a revised photometric solution of the binary system was derived. We confirmed that AH Cnc is a deep contact (f = 51%), low mass-ratio (q = 0.156) system. Adopting the distance modulus derived from study of the host cluster, we have re-calculated the physical parameters of the binary system, namely the masses and radii. The masses and radii of the two components were estimated to be respectively 1.188(±0.061) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, 1.332(±0.063) R <SUB>⊙</SUB> for the primary component and 0.185(±0.032) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, 0.592(±0.051) R <SUB>⊙</SUB> for the secondary.

This shows that the orbital period of the binary is continuously increasing at a rate of dp/dt = 4.29 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. In addition to the long-term period increase, a cyclic variation with a period of 35.26 yr was determined, which could be attributed to an unresolved tertiary component of the system."

We derived an updated ephemeris and found there a cyclic variation overlaying a continuous period increase (V1101 Her) and decrease (AD Phe). This kind of cyclic variation may be attributed to the light time effect via the presence of the third body or magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period increase suggests that V1101 Her is undergoing a mass-transfer from the primary to the secondary component (dM<SUB>1</SUB>/dt = 2.64(±0.11) × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) with the third body (P<SUB>3</SUB> = 13.9(±1.9) years), or 2.81(±0.07) × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for an increase andmagnetic cycle (12.4(±0.5) years).

We determined their orbital and geometrical parameters. For AD Phe, we simultaneously analyzed our BVRI light curves and the spectroscopic observations obtained by Duerbeck &amp; Rucinski. The spectral type of V1101 Her was classified as G0 ± 2V by LAMOST stellar spectra survey. The asymmetry of the R-band light curve of AD Phe obtained by McFarlane &amp; Hilditch in 1987 is explained by a cool spot on the primary component."

Complete light curves of J015100 in B, V, R, and I bands are presented and are analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney method. It has been discovered that J015100 is a shallow-contact binary (f = 14.6(±2.7)%) with a mass ratio of 3.128. It is a W-type contact binary where the less massive component is about 130 K hotter than the more massive one. The asymmetries of light curves are explained as one dark spot on the more massive component. The detection of J015100 as a contact binary below the period limit suggests that contact binaries below this limit are not rapidly destroyed. This shallow-contact system may be formed from a detached short-period binary similar to DV Psc (Sp. = K4/K5; P = 0.ͩ30855) via orbital shrinkage due to angular momentum loss through magnetic stellar wind."

      "abstract": "According to the general catalog of variable stars, AL Cas was classified as an EW-type eclipsing binary with a spectral type of B and an orbital period of P = 0.5005555 days. The first photometric light curves of the close binary in the B, V, R, and I bands are presented. New low-resolution spectra indicate that its spectral type is about F7 rather than B-type. A photometric analysis with the Wilson-Devinney method suggests that it is a contact binary (f = 39.3%) with a mass ratio of 0.61. Using 17 newly determined eclipse times together with those collected from the literature, we found that the observed-calculated (O - C) curve of AL Cas shows a cyclic change with a period of 86.6 yr and an amplitude of 0.0181 days. The periodic variation was analyzed for the light-travel time effect via the presence of a third body. The mass of the third body was determined to be M <SUB>3</SUB>sin i' = 0.29(± 0.05) M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when a total mass of 2.14 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> for AL Cas is adopted. It is expected that the cool companion star may have played an important role in the origin and evolution of the system by removing angular momentum from the central binary system during early dynamical interaction and/or late dynamical evolution. This causes the original detached system to have a low angular momentum and a short initial orbital period. Then it can evolve into the present contact configuration via a case A mass transfer."

The results show that the system is a W-type overcontact system with a filling-out factor of 23% and a mass ratio of q = 1.23, thus it is a new target which belongs to the rare group of overcontact binary with period under the short period limit (0.22 days). The obviously asymmetries found in its light curves could be explained well by the high spots coverage on the two components which have strong magnetic activities due to their late type nature. A third light contributing about 40% of the total light has been detected during the light curve analysis.

      "abstract": "Twenty-four 10 A/mm spectra of the W UMa binary AH Vir have been analyzed for radial velocities and for geometrical parameters of the system components by the method of spectral-line broadening functions. It is shown that the broadening functions determined through the linear restoration process are much better defined than cross-correlation functions, even in the presence of broad spectral features. A new spectroscopic orbit for AH Vir has been determined on the basis of radial velocity information contained in the broadening functions. A combination of this orbit with a parallel solution for the geometric elements gave a new set of absolute elements of the system: a = 2.80 solar radii, M1 = 1.36 solar mass, M2 = 0.41 solar mass, R1 = 1.40 solar radius, and R2 = 0.83 solar radius. The absolute bolometric magnitude of the system was found to be 4.07 m and the distance about 94 pc. AH Vir belongs to the OO Aq1 subclass of contact binaries which is characterized by the unusually low effective temperature for the observed large dimensions. The radius of the primary is close to what would be expected if it obeyed the Main-Sequence mass-radius relation, but the luminosity of the system (most likely produced solely by the primary component) is lower than that for the ZAMS. The underluminosity of the system is due to the abnormally low effective temperature which remains significantly low after the energy transfer between components is taken into account."

The preliminary photometric solutions with a cool star-spot are derived by using the 2013 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The photometric solutions suggest that 1SWASP J200503.05-343726.5 is a shallow-contact eclipsing binary(f = 9.0 %) with a mass ratio of q = 1.0705 , which is very high for late-type binary systems near the period limit. The primary component is about 230 K hotter than the secondary component. Based on our new CCD eclipse times, the orbital period change was analyzed. According to O - C diagram, the orbital period of the 1SWASP J200503.05-343726.5 shows an increase at a rate of P˙ = + 5.43 ×10<SUP>-8</SUP> days year-<SUP>1</SUP>. The period increase may be caused by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one.

The two sets of derived light curves show a large difference in their shape, i.e., the 2013 light curves show big asymmetry, whereas the 2014 light curve is almost symmetric. All light curves were analysed using the 2013 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The obtained solutions show that 1SWASP J075102.16+342405.3 is of the A subtype W UMa contact system with an extremely high fill-out of f ≈ 96% and a high mass ratio of 0.70-0.78. Furthermore, a third light contributing to the total flux of the system was found. All these properties make the system a very special short-period source. The analysis of the 2013 light curves proved that the changes in the light curve shape are caused by magnetic activities. By means of all available times of minimum light, the variation of the orbital period was studied. It was found that the O - C diagram implies an increasing orbital period over a time span of eight years, which may be caused by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one; however, we are more inclined to say that it is only a part of a long period cyclic variation which can be explained by the light-travel time effect (LTTE) via the third body."

We serendipitously found this X-ray point source outside the error ellipse when searching for possible X-ray counterparts of γ-ray millisecond pulsars among the unidentified objects detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The optical counterpart of the X-ray source (unrelated to the γ-ray source) was then identified using archival databases. The long-term Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey detected a precise signal with a period of P=0.28876208(56) days. A follow-up observation made by the Super Light Telescope of Lulin Observatory revealed the binary nature of the object. Utilizing archived photometric data of multi-band surveys, we construct the spectral energy distribution (SED), which is well fit by a K2V spectral template. The fitting result of the orbital profile using the Wilson-Devinney code suggests that 2MASS J11201034-2201340 is a short-period A-type contact binary and the more massive component has a cool spot. The X-ray emission was first noted in observations made by Swift, and then further confirmed and characterized by an XMM-Newton observation. The X-ray spectrum can be described by a power law or thermal Bremsstrahlung. Unfortunately, we could not observe significant X-ray orbital modulation. Finally, according to the SED, this system is estimated to be 690 pc from Earth with a calculated X-ray intensity of (0.7-1.5)× {10}<SUP>30</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is in the expected range of an X-ray emitting contact binary."

      "abstract": "We present a CCD photometry study of a newly discovered active eclipsing binary in the field of open cluster NGC 1348 based on the first time-series photometric observation. From the minimum times, we determined an orbital period of P = 0.691363 d. Among our datasets, the BV (RI)<SUB>c</SUB> light curves obtained in November 2008 were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney light curve modeling technique. Because of the uncertainty of the membership of this binary in open cluster NGC 1348, we have analyzed the photometric data in two cases with different primary effective temperatures: Case A (T<SUB>1</SUB> = 7750 K) and Case B (T<SUB>1</SUB> = 5250 K). Our analyses reveal that, for Case A, it is a deep (f &gt; 70%), very low mass ratio (q ⋍ 0.096) binary system, indicating that it is now in the late evolution stage of a contact binary; while for Case B, it is a red system with extraordinarily long orbital period with respect to the period-color relation for normal contact binaries, which suggests that this binary has evolved off the main sequence. The well known O'Connell effect (e.g., ΔB ⋍ 0.03 mag) was found in the dataset obtained in November 2008, which could be due to the existence of starspots on the components, therefore the corresponding spot properties (for Case A: hot spot; for Case B: dark spot) were determined using the Wilson-Devinney code. With the purpose of analyzing the dark spot activity for Case B, we compared the light curves derived in different observing runs, and found that a slight change appeared from November to December, 2008, which indicates the evolution of spot activity on at least one component over a time scale of about one month."

In the present paper, the first detailed studies of the two contact binary systems are carried out. Firstly, based on the light curves, 28 times of minimum light were detected for V4 and 21 times of minimum light for V5, respectively. Secondly, the orbital periods of V4 and V5 were redetermined as P<SUB>V4</SUB> = 0.40032(5) days and P<SUB>V5</SUB> = 0.30752 (4)days, respectively.

In order to characterize these four newly discovered binaries, we derived their orbital periods by their times of light minimum, estimated their effective temperatures based on their (J — H) colors and analyzed their light curves using the Wilson-Devinney light curve modeling technique. Our analyses reveal that all of them are contact binaries with short orbital periods of less than 0.5 d, with spectral types from late-F to mid-K. Among them, one is a typical A subtype contact binary with a mass ratio around 0.5 and a period of 0.44 d, and one is an H subtype contact binary with a high mass ratio around 0.9 and a short period of about 0.27 d. The other two systems show low amplitudes of light variation (A<SUB>R<SUB>c</SUB></SUB> &lt;=0.11<SUP>m</SUP>) their actual photometric mass ratios could not be determined by the light curve modelings, probably due to their attributes of being partially eclipsing stars. A preliminary analysis for these two systems indicates that both of them are likely to be W subtype contact binaries with low orbital inclinations. In addition, both of these two low amplitude variables show asymmetric distorted light curves (e.g., O'Connell effect of ΔR<SUB>c</SUB> ≃0.02<SUP>m</SUP>) during the observing runs, suggesting the presence of starspots on these two systems. More interestingly, the one showing a large case of the O'Connell effect presented a remarkable variation in the shape of the light curve on a time scale of one day, indicating that this star is in a very active state. Therefore, these two stars need spectroscopic observations to precisely determine their parameters, as well as further photometric observations to understand the properties of their magnetic activity, e.g., the evolution of starspots."

An assumption wasmade that a possible reason of this is the presence of hot and/or cold spots on the surface of the components, shifting the effective center of brightness of the visible disk of the component with respect to its center of mass position. It was shown that the AM Leo light curve variations on the time scales of one and more days, registered within the photometric part of the study may be described by the choice of appropriate model of the spot structure."

      "abstract": "We present a detailed light-curve analysis of publicly available V-band observations of 62 binary stars, mostly contact binaries, obtained by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS)-3 project between 2000 and 2009. Eclipsing binaries are important astronomical targets for determining the physical parameters of component stars from the geometry of their orbits. They provide an independent direct method of measuring the radii of stars. We improved the ASAS determined periods and ephemerides, and obtained the Fourier parameters from the phased light curves of these 62 stars. These Fourier parameters were used for preliminary classification of the stars in our sample. The phased light curves were then analysed with the aid of the Wilson-Devinney light-curve modelling technique in order to obtain various geometrical and physical parameters of these binaries. The spectroscopic mass ratios as determined from the radial velocity measurements available in the literature were used as one of the inputs to the light-curve modelling. Thus reliable estimations of parameters of these binaries were obtained with combined photometric and spectroscopic data, and error estimates were made using the heuristic scan method. For several systems in the sample, the solutions were obtained for the first time and would serve as a good source in the future for light-curve analysis based on more precise follow-up CCD photometric observations. Out of 62 stars in the sample, photometric analysis of 39 stars is presented here for the first time using the ASAS photometry and precise spectroscopic mass ratios. From the analysis, we found 54 contact binaries, six semidetached binaries and two detached binaries. The Fourier parameters in the a<SUB>2</SUB>-a<SUB>4</SUB> plane were used for preliminary classification, and the final classification was done based on the Roche lobe geometry obtained from the light-curve modelling."

The combination of our new determinations of minimum times and those collected from the literatures reveal a long-term period increase with a rate of dP/dt = +3.27 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> day yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which can be accounted for by angular momentum transfer as the less-massive component loses its mass to the more massive one. One cyclical oscillation (A‧ = 0.00300 day and P‧ = 20.09 yr) superimposed on the long-term period increase tendency is attributed to one additional object that orbits BH Cas. The low-resolution spectra of this source are observed at phase ∼0.0 and ∼0.5 in 2018 and 2019, and the spectral types are identified as K3V ± 1 and G8V ± 2. According to the luminosity contributions and spectra at these phases, the spectral type of the primary star is close to K3V ± 1. We infer a cool spot on the hotter and less-massive component to fit the asymmetry of light curves. In addition, changes in the location, temperature, and area of spots on the secondary star in different observations may indicate that the magnetic field activity of the secondary is more active than that of the primary. Such strong spot activities and optical flare are both detected at the same time from a W UMa-type star for the first time. With the XMM-Newton observations taken in 2003 and 2012, the X-ray light curve is obtained and the X-ray spectra can be well described with a blackbody or a bremsstrahlung model.

The first charge-coupled device (CCD) light curves of the binary in the BVRI obtained on 2012 August 21 are presented and are analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney code. It is discovered that BI Vul is a marginal contact binary system (f = 8.7%) that contains two very similar cool components (q = 1.037). Both the marginal contact configuration and the extremely high mass ratio suggest that it is presently evolving into contact with little mass transfer between the components and it is at the beginning stage of contact evolution. By using all available times of minimum light, the variations in the orbital period are investigated for the first time. We find that the observed - calculated (O - C) curve of BI Vul shows a cyclic change with a period of 10.8 yr and an amplitude of 0.0057 days, while it undergoes a downward parabolic variation. The cyclic oscillation is analyzed for the light-travel time effect that arises from the gravitational influence of a possible third stellar object. The mass and orbital separation of the third body are estimated as M <SUB>3</SUB> ~ 0.30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and ~4.9 AU, respectively. The downward parabolic change reveals a long-term period decrease at a rate of \\dot{P}=-9.5\\times {10^{-8}} days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The period decrease may be caused by angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind and/or it is only a part of a long-period (longer than 32 yr) cyclic variation, which may reveal the presence of another stellar companion in a wider orbit. These observational properties indicate that the formation of the Siamese twin is driven by magnetic braking and the third stellar companion should play an important role by removing angular momentum from the central binary."

The light curve exhibits a total eclipse at secondary minima along with an O'Connell effect. The light curve was modelled using the Wilson-Devinney code and the best solution provides the mass ratio q ∼ 0.106 and fill-out factor f ∼ 72 per cent. These parameters indicate that the system is a low-mass-ratio overcontact binary with a high degree of geometrical contact. The Hα line equivalent width varied at different phases and it is found that the line is possibly filled in at secondary minima. From a small sample of overcontact binaries, we found a correlation between the orbital period and Hα line equivalent width of the primary component. Based on a sample of high filling factor and low-mass-ratio contact binaries, a mass ratio cut-off is observed at q<SUB>critical</SUB> = 0.085 in the mass-ratio-period plane. It was observed that for q<SUB>critical</SUB> &lt; 0.085, the period decreases with an increase of q, and above it the period increases as the mass ratio increases. Interestingly, the observed mass ratio cut-off value lies close to the critical mass ratio range as predicted in the literature. The observational evidence of the cut-off of the mass ratio and its variation with orbital period are discussed in terms of mass transfer and angular momentum loss. Based on the results, we suggest that, ASAS J082243+1927.0 is at the verge of merger, eventually forming a fast rotating star."

The light curves exhibit totality along with a trace of the O’Connell effect. The photometric solution indicates that this system falls into the category of extreme low-mass ratio overcontact binaries with a mass ratio, q ∼ 0.06. Although a trace of the O’ Connell effect is observed, constancy of the Hα line along various phases suggest that a relatively higher magnetic activity is needed for it to show a prominent fill-in effect. The study of O-C variations reveals that the period of the binary shows a secular increase at the rate of dP/dt ∼ 0.0765 s years<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is superimposed by a low, but significant, sinusoidal modulation with a period of ∼8.25 years. Assuming that the sinusoidal variation is due to the presence of a third body, orbital elements have been derived. There exist three other similar systems, SX Crv, V857 Her, and E53, which have extremely low mass ratios and we conclude that ASAS J083241+2332.4 resembles SX Crv in many respects. Theoretical studies indicate that at a critical mass ratio range, q<SUB>critical</SUB> = 0.07-0.09, overcontact binaries should merge and form a fast rotating star, but it has been suggested that q<SUB>critical</SUB> can continue to fall up to 0.05 depending on the primary's mass and structure. Moreover, the obtained fill-out factors (50%-70%) indicate that mass loss is considerable and hydrodynamical simulations advocate that mass loss from L<SUB>2</SUB> is mandatory for a successful merging process. Comprehensively, the results indicate that ASAS J083241+2332.4 is at a stage of merger.

By investigating all of the available times of light minima, it is found that the Observed-Calculated [(O - C) ] curve shows a long-term period increase, with a rate of dP / dt = +(3.46 ± 0.01) ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> day/year. As an extreme mass-ratio contact binary, AS CrB may merge into a single star, such as an FK Com-type star or a blue straggler, because of the orbital instability."

Photometric models were deduced from new observations using the updated Wilson-Devinney Code. The results show that GN Boo and BL Leo are W-type contact binaries, while V1918 Cyg is an A-type one. The mass ratios and fill-out factors are q = 0.320(± 0.002) and f = 5.8(± 0.1)% for GN Boo, q = 0.476(± 0.005) and f = 21.3(± 1.1)% for BL Leo, q = 0.264(± 0.002), and f = 49.7(± 0.7)% for V1918 Cyg, respectively. From the (O - C) curves, it is discovered that the orbital periods of three binaries have varied in a complicated way, i.e., cyclic oscillation for GN Boo, long-term period decrease for BL Leo, and both for V1918 Cyg. The cyclic variations for GN Boo and V1918 Cyg may probably be attributed to the magnetic activity of the primary component or light-time effect due to the third body. Meanwhile, the secular period decreases for BL Leo and V1918 Cyg may result from mass transfer from the primary to the secondary, accompanying the mass and angular momentum loss from the central system. Finally, GN Boo, BL Leo, and V1918 Cyg will evolve into deep contact binaries. Additionally, a statistical study of 37 contact binaries with decreasing periods is given. We obtained the relations of q - f and q - dln P/dt, and preliminarily determined the mass loss rate of dln M/dt from the binary system."

The long-term photometric behaviors of the system are obtained from detailed studies of the period and light variations, based on historical data and our new observations. All available light curves display total eclipses at secondary minima and inverse O'Connell effects with Max I fainter than Max II, which were satisfactorily modeled by adding a slightly time-varying hot spot on the primary star. A total of 87 times of minimum lights spanning over ∼74 yr, including our 22 timing measurements, were used for ephemeris computations. A detailed analysis of the O - C diagram disclosed that the orbital period shows an upward parabola in combination with a sinusoidal variation. The continuous increase of period at a rate of +5.65 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is consistent with that calculated from the Wilson-Devinney synthesis code. It can be interpreted as a mass transfer from the secondary star to the primary at a rate of 2.74 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is one of the largest rates between components of the contact system. The most likely explanation of the sinusoidal variation having a period of 30.2 yr and a semiamplitude of 0.0062 d is a light-travel-time effect due to the existence of a circumbinary object. We suggest that BX Dra is probably a triple system, consisting of a primary star with a spectral type of F0, its secondary component of spectral type F1-2, and an unseen circumbinary object with a minimum mass of M<SUB>3</SUB> = 0.23 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>."

Complete light curves in R<SUB>c</SUB> and I<SUB>c</SUB> bands are presented that show a positive O'Conell effect. The light maxima following the primary minima are higher than the other ones in both bands. Photometric solutions obtained with the W-D (Wilson and Devinney) method suggest that AQ Com is a contact binary with a contact degree of f = 21.4 (± 6.2) % . It is found that the contact binary is a W-type system with a mass ratio of q = 2.86 where the less massive component is hotter than the more massive one in a common convective envelope. The asymmetries of the light curves are explained by two dark spots on the more massive component. By combining several determined times of light minimum with the others compiled from the literature, it is detected that the Observed-Calculated (O-C) curve may display a cyclic change with a period of 8.5 years and an amplitude of 0.0016 days. The cyclic oscillation may be caused by the presence of a cool third stellar object at an orbital separation of about ∼ 4.2 AU.

The highly overcontact geometry that actually fits the system's ellipsoidal light variation reproduce the total breadth of the lines but give profiles too broad to fit their shapes. The best solution to this dilemma is differential rotation of both stars in which the mid-latitudes are rotating 20-30 per cent slower than synchronously. This approach preserves the traditional light-curve solution and explains the drift of ripples seen in the line profiles. In addition, there are obviously other flows superimposed on the rotation which make the profiles asymmetrical. Fitting the line profiles is complicated by uncertainties in how the equivalent widths of the lines change with effective temperature and how much they are limb darkened. The contribution of any point on the stellar surface to the equivalent width depends only very weakly on local temperature throughout the range of W UMa binaries. The limb darkening of the lines is probably small, although the effect remains unexplored. I also speculate about the nature of hypothetical star-spots in this system."

We have obtained physical parameters of the components based on combined analysis of new, multi-color light curves and spectroscopic mass ratio. This is the first time the latter has been determined for this object. We derived the contact configuration for the system with a very high filling factor of about 88%. We were able to reproduce the observed light curve, namely the flat bottom of the secondary minimum, only if a third light has been added into the list of free parameters. The resulting third light contribution is significant, about 20-24%, while the absolute parameters of components are: M<SUB>1</SUB> = 1.16, M<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.39, R<SUB>1</SUB> = 1.62 and R<SUB>2</SUB> = 1.00 (in solar units).

No cyclic, short-period variations have been found in the O-C diagram (but longer-term variations remain a possibility)."

We obtained full Johnson BV light curves, which were modelled with the Wilson-Devinney code. Radial velocities were measured with the cross-correlation method using IAU radial velocity standards as spectral templates. Period changes were studied with the O-C method, utilising published epochs of minimum light (XY Leo) and ASAS photometry (VZ Lib). <BR />Results: For three objects (DX Tuc, QY Hya, V870 Ara), absolute parameters have been determined for the first time. We spectroscopically detected the tertiary components in XY Leo and VZ Lib and discovered one in QY Hya. For XY Leo we updated the light-time effect parameters and detected a secondary periodicity of about 5100 d in the O-C diagram that may hint at the existence of short-period magnetic cycles. A combination of recent photometric data shows that the orbital period of the tertiary star in VZ Lib is likely to be over 1500 d. QY Hya is a semi-detached X-ray active binary in a triple system with K and M-type components, while V870 Ara is a contact binary with the third smallest spectroscopic mass ratio for a W UMa star to date (q = 0.082 ± 0.030). Being close to the theoretical minimum for contact binaries, this small mass ratio suggests that V870 Ara has the potential of constraining evolutionary scenarios of binary mergers.

The O'Connell effect in the V light curve obtained in 2001 by Yang and Liu was about ΔV=+0.015, but it vanished in our 2004 observations. The variations in the levels of both minima were seen. Our two epochs of light minimum and others compiled from the literature were used for the period study. It is shown that the types of some eclipse times were incorrect and the values of the period obtained by previous investigators were aliases that prevented formation of a plausible O-C curve. A new linear ephemeris was derived, and it is discovered that the orbital period of CU Tau shows a continuous decrease at a rate of dP/dt=-1.81×10<SUP>-6</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The present symmetric light curves were solved with the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code.

It is shown that the low mass ratio binary turns out to be a deep overcontact system with f=74.3%+/-11.3%. A period analysis with all collected times of light minimum revealed a combination of a long-term period decrease (dP/dt=-2.16×10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and a possible cyclic change with a period of 29.1 yr. The rapid long-term period decreases of both systems can be explained as a combination of the mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one and the angular momentum loss due to mass outflow from the L2 point. In that way, the overcontact degrees of the two systems will become deeper as their periods decrease, and finally they will evolve into a single rapid-rotation star. However, for CU Tau, the rate of the secular period decrease is very large when compared with the other systems of the same type. This suggests that the long-term period decrease may be part of a long-period periodic change, which we need more data to check."

The photometric study reveals that the mass ratio and the contact degree of V53 are q ∼ 0.078 and f ∼ 69%, respectively. The observed variation in the light curve can be explained by adjusting the spot parameters. V53 belongs to extreme mass ratio (q ≤ 0.25), deep contact (f ≥ 50%) binaries, and its mass ratio is close to the minimum mass ratio predicted by theoretical studies, making it a potential object for studying the evolution of binaries and the formation of blue stragglers and FK Com-type stars. The orbital period of V53 shows a long-term decrease at a rate of dp/dt = 5.89(±0.02) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This secular period decrease may be caused by the combination of mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive component and an angular momentum loss via magnetic braking. As this mass transfer and angular momentum loss continues, V53 will ultimately evolve into a single fast-rotation star. By studying the statistics of all the contact binaries in globular clusters that have been analyzed, we found a possible correlation between the contact degree and whether or not a contact binary is a blue straggler. A contact binary is likely to become a blue straggler when its fill-out factor is more than 46.25(±2.05)%. More samples should be introduced to confirm this preliminary result in the future."

The light curves are symmetric and show complete eclipses with an eclipse duration of 54 minutes. When comparing the present light curves with those published by González-Rojas et al., it is found that the depths of the two minima of the light curve have been interchanged, and the positive O'Connell effect has disappeared. The symmetric light curves in R and I bands were analyzed with the 2003 version of the W-D code. It is found that EM Piscium is a high fill-out overcontact binary system (f = 95.3 ± 2.7%) with an extreme mass ratio of q = 0.1487, suggesting that it is on the late evolutionary stage of late-type tidal-locked binaries. Based on the nine instances of light minimum that we determined and those published by previous investigators, it is discovered that the orbital period shows a cyclic period variation with a period of 3.3 years, while it undergoes a continuously rapid increase at a rate of dP/dt = +3.97 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> days year<SUP>-1</SUP>. The cyclic period reveals the presence of a tertiary companion, which may play an important role for the formation and evolution of the overcontact binary by drawing angular momentum from the central system via Kozai oscillation or a combination of Kozai cycle and tidal friction. The high fill-out, the extreme mass ratio, and the rapid period increase may suggest that the binary system is quickly evolving into a rapid-rotating single star."

      "abstract": "New CCD photometric observations of overcontact binary CW Cas were carried out in 2004 and 2011. In particular, the light curve obtained in 2004 shows a remarkable O'Connell effect. Compared with light curves in different observing seasons, variations were found. These variations can be explained by dark spot activities on the surface of at least one component. Using the Wilson-Devinney code with a spot model, we find that the photometric solutions confirm CW Cas is a shallow W-subtype overcontact binary with a spotted massive component. Our new determined times of minimum light together with the others published in the literature were analyzed to find a change of orbital period. From the O - C curves, the period of the system shows a cyclic period change (P <SUB>3</SUB> = 69.9 yr, A <SUB>3</SUB> = 0.03196 days) superposed on the linear increase. The cyclic variation, if explained as the light-travel time effect, reveals the presence of a tertiary companion."

      "abstract": "By analyzing the V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, and I<SUB>c</SUB> light curves of the two neglected W UMa-type binaries EF CVn and EH CVn using the Wilson-Devinney code, we have discovered that EF CVn is a median contact binary while EH CVn is a shallow contact binary, and they are both W-subtype binary systems. The mass ratio and fillout factor of EF CVn are q = 3.493 ± 0.063 and f = 32.0% ± 12.9%, respectively. Those of EH CVn are q = 3.331 ± 0.052 and f = 19.2% ± 10.9%, respectively. The addition of a dark spot on the secondary star is used to interpret the asymmetric light curves of EF CVn. An orbital period analysis of EF CVn indicates that there is a cyclic oscillation with an amplitude of 0.0064 d and a period of 15.65 yr, accompanied by a continuous increase at a rate of dp/dt = 4.52 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The periodic oscillation can reasonably be explained by the light travel-time effect of an additional component. The secular increase is probably generated by conservative mass transfer from the primary star to the secondary star. Meanwhile, an analysis of the orbital period of EH CVn was also performed. A long-term period decrease at a rate of dp/dt = -5.20 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP> was discovered; this is possibly interpreted as caused by mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive component."

They show that the system belongs to shallow contact W-type W UMa systems with a degree of overcontact of 8.7%. The observed light curve distortions are explained by employing the spots model due to the late-type nature of both components. We have collected all available photometric data about the system with emphasis on the individual observational data, which we treated simultaneously using our own method based on the usage of computed model light curves as templates. We recalculated published times of light minimum and added new ones of our own to construct an O - C diagram that spans over 70 years. Using a least squares method orthogonal quadratic model function, we found that the orbital period of DD Com is continuously increasing with \\dot{P}=0.00401(22) s yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The period increase may be caused by the mass transfer from the less-massive component to the more-massive one. With the period increase, the binary is evolving from the present shallow contact phase to the broken stage predicted by the thermal relaxation oscillation (TRO) theory. Compared with other VSP systems, DD Com is a rare system that lies on the expanding phase of the TRO cycle. Until now, only four such systems including DD Com are found in this stage. Thus, this target is another good observational proof of the TRO theory in a very short period region."

Historical light and velocity curves from 1962 to 2012 were simultaneously analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) synthesis code. The brightness disturbances were satisfactorily modeled by applying a magnetic cool spot on the primary star. Based on 261 times of minimum light that include 116 new timings and span more than 87 years, a period study reveals that the orbital period has varied due to a periodic oscillation superimposed on an upward parabola. The period and semi-amplitude of the modulation are about 78.1 years and 0.0037 days, respectively.

It is sure that this contact binary is a foreground object of the globular cluster 47 Tuc.

The cool spots model is introduced in the BV-band photometric solutions because of the observed O'Connell effect. We compare the two modeling cool spots in size, temperature and position, thinking that they could be the same one. It can be explained as that a cool spot, which is on the surface of the more massive component, shifted 126 degrees along the latitude line from west to east in a year. This phenomenon may be called as starspot migration."

We recommend spectroscopic study of DN Aur even though the light curve analysis show it to be a single line spectroscopic system.

The fifth (V3) is less likely to be simply on the basis of its position in the CMD, but it is, formally, a member on the basis of derived distance. Three of the probable members are contact binaries with contact parameters ranging from 0.06 to 0.27. The fourth probable member (V4) is a detached or semidetached Algol-type system, the detached model being the more likely. The absolute parameters of all the systems were calculated, and the individual components were placed on the M71 CMD.

The best photometric solution incorporating a dark spot over the primary component unveils that the system has a low-mass ratio (q ∼ 0.17) and a high inclination (I ∼ 85°). To confirm the solution and constrain the uncertainty, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed and the results are reported. Based on the O-C diagram analysis, we see that the variable shows a period increase at the rate of dP/dt ∼ 1.06 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is higher than the theoretically predicted value. Presence of a third body having a period of ∼16.23 years is evident from the O-C diagram. No filled-in effect is observed in the Hα line, while the effect is vividly present in the Na line. From the Kepler K2 data, we found that the primary and secondary minima exhibit an anti-correlated O-C variation followed by an erratic behavior. This is possibly caused by the longitudinal motion of the spot, and hence, we set a lower limit of ∼40 days for the spot modulation. We also observe a possibly associated photometric difference in the primary depth by comparing our light curves with Kepler K2 normalized light curves. This system has a low-mass ratio and a high fill-out factor, and, theoretically, such a physical configuration would lead to a merger."

      "abstract": "Two contact binaries, GQ Boo and V1367 Tau, were observed and analysed with a new method to obtain the absolute parameters. The light-curve analysis shows that both of them are obvious W-subtype contact binaries, with much more massive but apparently cooler components (M<SUB>2</SUB>/M<SUB>1</SUB> ≃ 2 and 4, T<SUB>2</SUB>/T<SUB>1</SUB> ≃ 0.95 and 0.94). The orbital periods were studied using the O-C diagrams, and it is thought that the minima timings were heavily affected by the longstanding magnetic activities on the star surface, so the minima timings cannot represent the real period changes. The mass-radius relationships were proposed by the light-curve analysis alone, which is equivalent to the mean density. The density and temperature can determine the other absolute parameters in most of the time. With the almost complete star parameter space provided by PARSEC, approximate masses and radii were obtained (0.52 ± 0.08 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 1.01 ± 0.15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for GQ Boo, and 0.22 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.92 ± 0.06 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for V1367 Tau).

      "abstract": "CCD photometric observations of the short-period eclipsing binary GSC 0763-0572 were carried out in the B and V bands at Yunnan Observatory in China. Three light minimum times were determined from the observations and the orbital period of this system was revised. Photometric solutions for three W UMa-type stars (i.e., GSC 0763-0572, RR Cen, and ɛ CrA) were deduced by the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney code with and without third lights. All three systems are found to be A-type eclipsing binaries with low mass ratios. Combining with the radial-velocity curves for RR Cen (King, Hilditch 1984, MNRAS, 209, 645) and ɛ CrA (Goecking, Duerbeck 1993, A&amp;A, 278, 463), the absolute parameters for those two binaries were redetermined. Based on all minimum times of RR Cen, it is found that the orbital period shows a long-term increase superimposed on a cyclic variation. The secular change with a rate of dP/dt = +1.21 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP> may suggest that RR Cen is undergoing mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary one with dm/dt = +3.12 ×10<SUP>-8</SUP>M<SUB>odot</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The cyclic oscillation with a period of 65.1(±0.4)yr and an amplitude of 0.0124(±0.0007) d may be explained by the presence of a third body, which can be identified by the revised photometric solution. It is believed that if the orbital period increases for those systems is true, this kind of binary may evolve into a rapid-rotating single star."

Isochrone fitting was applied to the cleaned cluster sequence, yielding a distance modulus of (m-M{)}<SUB>V</SUB><SUP>0</SUP> = 11.35+/- 0.10 {{mag}} and a total foreground reddening of E(V - R) = 0.062 ± 0.002 mag. Light-curve solutions were obtained for eight W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binary systems (W UMas), and their orbital parameters were estimated. Using the latter parameters, we estimate a distance to the W UMas that is independent of the host cluster’s physical properties. Based on combined fits to six of the W UMas (EP Cep, EQ Cep, ES Cep, V369 Cep, and—for the first time—V370 Cep and V782 Cep), we obtain an average distance modulus of (m-M{)}<SUB>V</SUB><SUP>0</SUP> = 11.31+/- 0.08 {{mag}}, which is comparable to that resulting from our isochrone fits. These six W UMas exhibit an obvious period-luminosity relation. We derive more accurate physical parameters for the W UMa systems and discuss their initial masses and ages. The former show that these W UMa systems have likely undergone angular momentum evolution within a convective envelope (W-type evolution). The ages of the W UMa systems agree well with the cluster’s age."

The long-term increase of the orbital period can be explained by mass transfer from the less-massive component to the more-massive one.

Except for MU Cnc, the limited number of time-of-minimum values precluded the characterization of any long-term period change. Since a total eclipse is observed with all five systems, Roche modeling based on the Wilson-Devinney W-D code yielded in each instance a well-constrained photometric value for the mass ratio. <P />Using the evolutionary model of cool close binaries we searched for possible progenitors of the investigated binaries. The best fit is obtained if the initial binaries have orbital periods from the interval between 2.4-3.4 d, total masses between 6% and 9% higher than presently observed and mass ratios between 2.2 and 3.3. The model progenitors need between 7.5-10 Gyr to attain the presently observed parameters of the variables. The present periods of three models slowly increase with simultaneous mass ratio decrease, which suggests the formation of the common envelope in the future. However, in four other models the period decreases and the model computations predict the ultimate overflow of the outer Roche lobe."

All historical light curves, obtained over a 30 yr interval, display striking light changes, and are best modeled by the simultaneous existence of a cool spot and a hot spot on the more massive cool component star. The facts that the system is magnetically active and that the hot spot has consistently existed on the inner hemisphere of the star indicate that the two spots are formed by (1) magnetic dynamo-related activity on the cool star and (2) mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component. Based on 38 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code and all other minimum epochs, a period study of GW Cep reveals that the orbital period has experienced a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 32.6 yr and 0.009 days, respectively. In principle, these may be produced either by a light-travel-time effect due to a third body or by an active magnetic cycle of at least one component star. Because we failed to find any connection between luminosity variability and the period change, that change most likely arises from the existence of an unseen third companion star with a minimum mass of 0.22 M <SUB>sun</SUB> gravitationally bound to the eclipsing pair."

      "abstract": "Here we present the first analysis of the B, V and I<SUB>c</SUB> CCD light curves of the W UMa type eclipsing binary star FI Lyn obtained in the year 2009 (8 nights) and in the year 2010 (2 nights), and new CCD V and R<SUB>c</SUB> light curves of the known contact eclipsing binary GN Boo obtained in 4 nights in May 2012. Our data permits us the determination of ten and six new times of minimum light respectively for FI Lyn and GN Boo and refine both the orbital periods of the systems to P = 0.3732612 days and P = 0.3016022 days. The periods of both the systems are variable. FI Lyn shows an increasing period at the rate of dP / dt 1.05 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> while GN Boo shows cyclic oscillations. The observed light curves are analyzed simultaneously with the Wilson-Devinney program analysis; the geometrical and photometric elements are derived. Our solutions show that FI Lyn and GN Boo belong to the W-subtype W Ursae Majoris contact binary class, consisting of a hotter, less massive primary star eclipsed at primary minimum with a primary spectral type of G1 and G8 and a companion of spectral type G3 and G4 respectively. We found, for FI Lyn a mass ratio of q = 2.58 , the degree of contact of f = 38.9 % , an orbital inclination of i = 71 ° .5 and a small temperature difference between the components of about Δ T = 150 K indicating a good thermal contact, while for GN Boo we found a mass ratio of q = 3.33 , the degree of contact of f = 24.3 % , an orbital inclination of i = 83 ° .6 and a difference between the components temperature of about Δ T = 620 K. The elements obtained from the W-D analysis are used to compute the physical parameters of the systems in order to study their evolutionary status."

The present observations were taken in 2012 September and are of high precision, averaging a standard deviation of better than 5 mmag. The amplitude of the light curve is very nearly 0.5 mag yet it undergoes total eclipses. Dominion Astrophysical Observatory spectra give an F3V type (T∼ 6900 K) for the system, the earliest of the extreme mass ratio W UMa binaries. The linear period determination of 0.4045672 days was calculated with the two sets of epochs available. An early NSVS light curve reveals that the period has been smoothly decreasing over its past 12,000 orbits. The binary may be undergoing sinusoidal oscillations due to the presence of a third body, possibly with a period of 23+/- 3 years. The high inclination of 85° results in a long duration secondary total eclipse, lasting some 49.5 minutes.

It is shown that V473 Cas is a semidetached system with the primary component or the secondary component at its critical Roche Lobe, while II Per is a marginal contact binary system with both components filling their critical Roche Lobes, but with a large temperature difference between the two components. Both systems belong to near-contact binaries with the light curves enhanced around the left shoulder of secondary minimum, which can be explained by hot spots on the secondary components due to the mass transfer via a stream hitting the facing surface of the secondary components. The orbital period investigations based on all available times of light minimum show a secular period existing in these two targets decreasing at the rate of dP/dt = -7.61 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for V473 Cas and dP/dt = -7.54 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for II Per. The decrease of the orbital period can be the result of mass transfer from the primary component to the secondary one, which is consistent with the asymmetric light curves of V473 Cas and II Per. Therefore, V473 Cas and II Per are other examples displaying evidence of mass transfer between the two components. We have collected NCBs with secular period variation and find that almost all SD1-type NCBs show decreasing periods and enhancing luminosity on the left shoulder of secondary minimum in their light curves. So the semidetached configuration with the lobe filling primary is more plausible for V473 Cas. Furthermore, the detected enhancing amplitude of luminosity for SD2-type NCBs is smaller than other types of NCBs, which implies that the mass transfer from the primary component to the secondary one is stronger than the transfer in opposite direction. With the orbital period decrease, V473 Cas and II Per will evolve into overcontact binaries with true thermal contact."

We explore the use of this distinctive timing signature to identify precursors, developing the observational and analysis steps needed. We estimate that our Galaxy has roughly 1-10 observable precursors. Specifically, we lay out the observational case for KIC 9832227, which we identified as a tentative candidate two years ago (Molnar et al. 2015, AAS Meeting #225 Abstracts 415.05). Orbital timing over the past two years has followed the tentative exponential fit. As of late 2015, the period time derivative went beyond the range found in other systems (\\dot{P}&lt; | 1× {10}<SUP>-8</SUP>| ), a necessary criterion for a serious candidate.

Photometric solutions reveal that MR Com is a W-type system with a mass ratio of q = 3.9 where the less massive component is about 90 K hotter than the more massive one. By investigating all of the available times of minimum light, we found that the general trend of the Observed-Calculated (O - C) curve shows a downward parabolic variation while it undergoes a cyclic variation with a small amplitude of 0.0031 days and a period of 10.1 yr. The downward parabolic change corresponds to a long-term decrease in the orbital period at a rate of \\dot{P}=-5.3\\times {10^{-7}} days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> that may be caused by a combination of a mass transfer and an angular momentum loss (AML) via magnetic braking. Among the 16 shallow-contact systems with a decreasing orbital period, MR Com has the lowest mass ratio (e.g., 1/q = 0.26). The shallow-contact configuration, the low-mass ratio, and the long-term period decrease all suggest that systems similar to MR Com are on the AML-controlled stage of the evolutionary scheme proposed by Qian. They will oscillate around a critical mass ratio and evolve into a deep contact with a higher mass ratio. The small-amplitude cyclic change in the O - C curve was analyzed for the light-travel time effect via the presence of an extremely cool stellar companion."

      "abstract": "II UMa is a late F-type (F5) contact binary with a close-in tertiary and a distant visual companion. According to the four-color (B V R<SUB>c</SUB>I<SUB>c</SUB>) light curves’ solutions of II UMa, it is a high fill-out (f = 86.6%) and low-mass ratio (q = 0.172) contact binary system, which indicates that it is at the late evolutionary stage of late-type tidal-locked binary stars. The masses of the primary star and secondary star are calculated to be {M}<SUB>1</SUB>=1.99{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> and {M}<SUB>2</SUB>=0.34{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. The primary star has evolved from the zero-age main sequence, but it still appeared before the terminal-age main sequence, and the secondary star is even more evolved. Considering the mass ratio ({M}<SUB>3</SUB>/{M}<SUB>1</SUB>=0.67) obtained by spectroscopic observations, the mass of the close-in tertiary is estimated to be {M}<SUB>3</SUB>=1.34{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. The period variations of the binary system are investigated for the first time. According to the observed-calculated (O-C) curve analysis, a continuous period increase at a rate of {dP}/{dt}=4.88× {10}<SUP>-7</SUP> {day} {{yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP> is determined. The parabolic variation in the O-C curve may be part of a cyclic period of change, or the combined period of change of a parabolic variation and a cyclic one. More instances of minimum light are needed to confirm this. The presence of the tertiary component may play an important role in the formation and evolution of this binary system by drawing angular momentum from the central system during the pre-contact stage."

      "abstract": "Multi-color photometric light curves of NO Camelopardalis in V, R<SUB>C</SUB>, and I<SUB>C</SUB> bands are obtained and analyzed simultaneously using the Wilson-Devinney program. The solutions suggest that NO Cam is an A-subtype overcontact binary with a mass ratio of q = 0.439 and a contact degree of f = 55.5%. The small temperature difference (ΔT = 44 K) between its two components indicates that the system is under thermal contact. The high orbital inclination (i = 84.5°) strengthens our confidence in the parameters determined from the light curves. All available times of minimum light are collected and period variations are analyzed for the first time. The O - C curve reveals that its period is increasing continuously at a rate of dP/dt = +1.46 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, which can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. After the upward parabolic variation is subtracted, the residuals suggest that there may be a cyclic variation with a period of 2.23 yr and an amplitude of A<SUB>3</SUB> = 0.00153 d, which may due to the light-travel-time effect arising from the gravitational influence of a close-in tertiary component. The close-in companion reveals that early dynamic interaction among a triple system may have played a very important role in the formation of the W UMa-type binaries."

      "abstract": "BV photometric light curves of the eclipsing binary IK Per were obtained during three nights in 2002 December. The photometric elements were computed using the Wilson-Devinney code. The results reveal that IK Per is an A-type overcontact binary system with a low mass ratio of q=0.17 and a large degree of overcontact of 60%. The asymmetry of the light curves (i.e., the O'Connell effect) is explained by spot models. The observed long-term orbital period decrease [dP/dt=-(2.5+/-0.09)×10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>] is probably influenced by the presence of a third body in the system. The low mass ratio, high degree of overcontact, and secular orbital decrease all indicate that the situation of IK Per resembles those of FG Hya, GR Vir, and AW UMa. Because of the decrease of their orbital periods, the shrinking of the inner and outer critical Roche lobes will lead the common envelopes to overlap more, and finally the systems will evolve into single rapid-rotation stars."

      "abstract": "NGC 7789 is an intermediate-age open cluster with an age similar to the mean age of contact binary stars. V12 is a bright W UMa-type binary star with an orbital period of 0.3917 days. The first complete light curves of V12 in the V, R, and I bands are presented and analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The results show that V12 is an intermediate-contact binary (f=43.0(+/- 2.2)%) with a mass ratio of 3.848, and it is a W-type contact binary where the less massive component is slightly hotter than the more massive one. The asymmetry of the light curves is explained by the presence of a dark spot on the more massive component. The derived orbital inclination (i=83{_.<SUP>\\circ</SUP>}6) indicates that it is a totally eclipsing binary, which suggests that the determined parameters are reliable. The orbital period may show a long-term increase at a rate of \\dot{P}=+2.48(+/- 0.17)× {{10}<SUP>-6</SUP>} days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> that reveals a rapid mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. However, more observations are needed to confirm this conclusion. The presence of an intermediate-contact binary in an intermediate-age open cluster may suggest that some contact binaries have a very short pre-contact timescale. The presence of a third body and/or stellar collision may help to shorten the pre-contact evolution."

Photometric solutions of two EW-type binaries, V7 and V8, in this cluster are presented by analyzing two sets light curves obtained by Kaluzny et al. We find that both of the two systems are contact binaries. V7 is a shallow contact W-type W UMa system with a contact degree of f = 2.7%, while V8 is an extremely low mass ratio (∼0.159) A-type W UMa system with a contact degree of f = 46.1%. We also analyzed the orbital period changes of the two binaries, long-term period increase has been detected for both binaries. The period increase may be caused by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. As the period increase, for V7, it will evolve to the expanding stage of the thermal relaxation oscillation cycle; for V8, it will merge into a rapidly rotating single star after the orbital angular momentum is less than three times the total spin angular momentum. On the color-magnitude diagram of NGC 6397, V7 occupies a position close to the cluster turn off, while V8 is located in faint blue straggler region. Therefore, V8 is an eclipsing blue straggler candidate and could be formed by mass transfer. By comparing the two binaries with contact binaries in the field, we find that evolutionary processes of contact binaries in the globular cluster low metallicity environment may be similar with that of contact binaries in the field high metallicity environment."

      "title": "The phase smearing effect in the light curves of contact binaries observed by the Kepler mission and the determination of the parameters of 17 contact systems",
      "abstract": "The Kepler mission observations, taken in the long cadence mode, have a time resolution of about 30 min. In this paper, we investigate how the long cadence binning influences the shapes of the light curves of eclipsing binaries. A simulated light curve of a contact binary exhibiting a flat-bottom secondary minimum was applied for this purpose. We found that the binning caused a change in the variation amplitude and the shape of the minima. We modelled the simulated light curves corresponding to periods between 0.2 and 2 d using a code that does not account for binning and we derived the parameters. It turned out that only when the binary period is close to or longer than about 1.5 d are the solutions derived with such a code accurate. Rigorous modelling of systems with shorter periods requires the use of codes that do account for phase smearing due to long exposure times. We selected a sample of contact binaries observed by the Kepler mission, exhibiting a flat-bottom secondary minimum and showing no intrinsic activity. We solved the light curves of the sample with the most recent (2015) version of the Wilson-Devinney code and we derived the system parameters. The best models that we derived indicate that most of the systems in our sample have a deep contact configuration and that 13 out of 17 required the addition of a third light for good fits. Our results suggest that 13 systems could have tertiary companions."

The new solutions suggest that HV Aqr is a low mass ratio (q=0.1455) deep contact binary with a contact degree of f=55.9%.

The continuous period decrease can be explained by the mass transfer from the primary component to the secondary and angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind.

The highest rate of orbital period increase was confirmed, which can be explained by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one.

We found that HH UMa is an A-subtype W UMa binary, which conflicts with the classification of Han et al. (2014) as a W-subtype. Seasonal variations observed in the light curves of the system are well explained with two cool stellar spots in our solution as opposed to the hot-spot based solution by Han et al. (2014), the presence of which would not cause such rapid period variations. The evolutionary status of the system is in agreement with the findings of our study. We modeled II UMa, another A-subtype overcontact binary, without surface spots and found that its both components have rather low surface gravities indicating an advanced state of evolution pointing to evolved subgiants. The high contact degree (f=74%) supports this viewpoint. Our analysis shows that there is a significant third light contribution, contradicting some of the previous analyses, which lack the detection of the secondary minima as total eclipses because they were not as evident as they are in our light curves."

In order to reveal the real physical status of this star, we took medium resolution (lambda /Delta lambda ~ 11000) spectra in the red spectral region centered at 6600 Ä. Spectra obtained around the assumed quadratures clearly showed the presence of the secondary component. An improved ephemeris calculated using our and Hipparcos epoch photometry is Hel.

This approximative approach gave a spectroscopic mass ratio of q_sp=0.19+/-0.03. A modified Lucy model containing a temperature excess of the secondary was fitted to the V light curve. The obtained set of physical parameters together with the parallax measurement indicate that this binary lies far from the galactic plane, and the primary component is an evolved object, probably a subgiant or giant star. The large temperature excess of the secondary may suggest a poor thermal contact between the components due to a relatively recent formation of this contact system.

Using the Wilson-Devinney binary code, a photometric solution was simultaneously derived from BVR light curves. The results show that LR Cam belongs to a W-type contact binary, with a mass ratio of q = 0.300(1) and an overcontact degree of f = 23.5(5)%, indicating that LR Cam is a weak-contact binary. The asymmetric light curves (i.e., the O'Connell effect) were modeled by a dark spot on the more massive component. From the (O - C) curve of LR Cam, it is found that the orbital period shows a sine-like variation superimposed on a secular period increase. The quasi-sinusoidal variation, with A = 0.<SUP>d</SUP>0039(1), P<SUB>3</SUB> = 5.34(2) yr, and e' = 0.56(3), may more likely result from a light-time effect via the presence of a third body. The long-term period increases at a rate of dP/dt = +0.65(9) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which may be interpreted by mass transfer from the less-massive component to the more-massive one. With mass transferring, LR Cam may evolve into a broken-contact binary."

The observations were made on 8 nights during 1993 and 1994 with V and R bandpass filters. From 7 determinations of eclipse timings of minimum (V&R together), we have determined a new epoch and an orbital period of 0.8664604 days. The published spectral classification is A9. The 1993 version of the Wilson-Devinney model gave the photometric solutions. The adopted solution indicates that KN Per is a W UMa type contact binary. The mass ratio, q = (m<SUB>2</SUB>/m<SUB>1</SUB>, where star 1 eclipses at the primary minimum) = 0.23 suggests that KN Per is a W UMa system with A-type configuration. The secondary minimum shows a total eclipse. The asymmetry in the light curve is fitted with a cold spot on the secondary component of the system. The luminosity difference between the components is very large KN Per therefore, is most likely a single line spectroscopic binary. We recommend spectroscopic study of this system. Generally contact systems of spectral type A9 have periods ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 days. KN Per has considerably longer period and thus appears to be an evolved contact system with case B mass transfer."

The solutions show that MW And is an eclipsing binary star of W UMa type. Our analysis suggests that the system has a light curve of W-subtype contact system. Its spectral type of K0/K1, as estimated from its color, places it in the Zero-Age contact zone of the period-spectral type diagram.

Surprisingly, little has been published in the intervening years. In 1999 it was characterized by a 0.31587 day orbital period. Since that time it has been observed by various observers who have determined ∼20 timings of minimum light over the past ∼15,000 orbits. Our observations in 2012 represent the first precision curves in the BVR<SUB>c</SUB>I<SUB>c</SUB> Johnson-Cousins wavelength bands. The light curves have rather low amplitudes, averaging some 0.5 magnitudes, yet they exhibit total eclipses, which is typical of the rare group of solar-type EMRBs. An improved linear ephemeris was computed along with a quadratic ephemeris showing a decaying orbit, which indicates magnetic breaking may be occurring. The light curve solution reveals that HR Boo is a contact system with a somewhat low 21% Roche-lobe fill-out but a mass ratio of q = 4.09 (0.2444), which defines it as an EMRB. Two spots, both hot, were allowed to iterate to fit the light curve asymmetries. Their radii are 32° and 16°. Both are high-latitude polar spots indicative of strong magnetic activity. The shallow contact yet nearly equal component temperatures makes it an unusual addition to this group."

Single passband and multi passband solutions made with normal points against those obtained using individual observations are compared. Solutions were performed keeping the gravity darkening exponent fixed, and the effects of letting it vary with the rest of the main adjustable parameters from a \"conservative\" converged solution, or from the beginning of the solution are investigated. The main results are that iterations should be continued until all adjustable parameters stabilize, and that a solution can be found starting with normal points and switching afterwards to individual observations without lost of accuracy and reaching convergence in a few iterations. Two final solutions are found. One is characterized mainly by a high g and a low degree of overcontact, the other by the opposite. The primary (more massive) component is in a moderate stage of evolution based in its mean density and color. Preliminary absolute dimensions are derived. The radius of the primary exceeds that of a normal MS star of the same effective temperature by 17% if the temperature correction due to luminosity transfer is considered, and by 30% if the correction is not taken into account. LT Pav would be a W UMa system with the most massive primary known to date, if the absolute dimensions can be confirmed."

One theory, according to which a W UMa system at or near zero-age cannot achieve thermal equilibrium and so undergoes thermal relaxation oscillations about a state of marginal contact, appears to be in substantial agreement with observational data. In particular, a previously admitted difficulty is to some extent overcome by the discovery of several possible examples of W UMa systems in the broken-contact phase of these oscillations. The second theory, according to which a W UMa system can achieve thermal equilibrium and does so through the development of a contact discontinuity at the inner contact surface of the secondary, appears, on the other hand, to be in substantial disagreement with the observational data. But since several of the disagreements may no longer apply when this theory achieves its final form - evolutionary sequences are at present indeterminate - it should not yet be regarded as contradicted."

In addition, the marginal contact phase, high mass ratio (1/q &gt; 0.4), and long-term decrease in period all suggest that RW Dor is a newly formed contact binary via Case A mass transfer, and it will evolve into a deeper normal contact binary.

The upward parabolic change reveals a long-term continuous increase in the orbital period at a rate of dP/dt = 5.57(±0.08) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The period increase can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive component (M <SUB>2</SUB> ∼ 0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) to the more massive one (M <SUB>1</SUB> ∼ 1.65 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). The binary will be merging when it meets the criterion that the orbital angular momentum is less than three times the total spin angular momentum, i.e., J <SUB>orb</SUB> &lt; 3J <SUB>rot</SUB>. This suggests that the system will finally merge into a rapid-rotating single star and may produce a luminous red nova. The cyclic oscillation in the O - C diagram can be interpreted by the light-travel time effect via the presence of a third body."

Combining new determined times of minimum light with others published in the literature, the O - C diagram of the binary star is investigated. A periodic variation, with a period of 5.22(±0.05) years and an amplitude of 0.0075(±0.0004) days, was discovered. Since the spectrum of a third component has been detected by Rucinski et al., we consider this cyclic period oscillation to be the result of the light-time effect due to the presence of a third body. This third component may also be a binary itself. Therefore, PY Vir should be a quadruple system composed of two cool-type binary systems. This system is a good astrophysical laboratory to study the formation and evolution of close binaries and multiple systems."

It is found that TY UMa is a W-subtype shallow contact binary system (f=13.4%) with a mass ratio of q = 2.523. In order to explain the asymmetric light curve of this binary, a dark spot on the less massive component was employed. Our newly determined 31 times of minimum light, including those collected from the literature, have been used to analyze orbital period changes of TY UMa. The complicated period variation could be sorted into a secular period increase at a rate of dp/dt\\=\\+5.18(+/- 0.21)× {{10}<SUP>-7</SUP>} days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a 51.7 yr periodic modulation (A<SUB>3</SUB> = 0.0182 days), and a very small amplitude cyclic oscillation with a period of 10.0 yr (A<SUB>4</SUB> = 0.0015 days). The long-term increase of the period can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. The Applegate mechanism may impossibly explain the two cyclic components in the period. The two cyclic variations are very likely caused by the light travel time effect of third and fourth components, suggesting that TY UMa is a quadruple system."

In the present paper new CCD photometric light curves in B, V, and R bands of BO CVn and the first complete light curve in V band of SS Com are presented. The light curves of the two binaries are symmetric, and no variations of the light curves were found for both systems that are quite unlike those of cooler overcontact binaries. These observational properties may suggest weak photospheric dark spot activity in the two systems during the observational time intervals. Photometric solutions of the two W UMa-type binaries were derived by using the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The new solutions suggest that they are overcontact binary stars with degrees of overcontact of f=40.6% for BO CVn and f=49.6% for SS Com. Our new times of light minimum confirmed the long-time period increases of the two systems, and the rates of continuous period increase were revised. The long-time period increases, the orbital periods, the degrees of overcontact, and the mass ratios all suggest that they are on an evolutionary stage of mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one, and SS Com will reach the present evolutionary state of BO CVn. The slow evolution toward extreme mass ratio will cause them finally to coalesce to single stars. Therefore, both of them are AW UMa-type near-coalescent overcontact binary systems."

The light-curve and spectroscopic analyses reveal the observations to be well represented by a model of an overcontact system composed of main-sequence F5 and G7 stars (temperature difference of nearly 1000 K), with the possible presence of a third star. Low-resolution optical spectroscopy reveals a complex H<SUB>α</SUB> emission and other features that are not yet understood. The unusually high mass ratio of q = 0.81 ± 0.05 places it in the rare “H” (high mass ratio) subclass of the W UMa systems, which are presumably on their way to coalescence."

However, its distance from the core of the cluster might exclude its membership. Its light curve was classified as a short period EB type eclipsing binary with a period of 0.3079 d and an amplitude of ~0.7 mags in all curves. The difference in component temperatures is some Delta T = 180 K and its fill-out is a hefty 35%. A brief, 2.5 year period study yields, as expected, a constant period, which is 0.3076789 d. More monitoring is needed to determine its true orbital evolution. The inclination, 80 degrees, is not quite enough to produce total eclipses, so a q-search was performed. Our lowest residual solution gives a q = 0.4. A cool spot was modeled on the primary component to take care of the light curve asymmetries. V428 Cep is a K-type W UMa contact binary."

      "abstract": "New multiband BVRI light curves of NSVS 1461538 were obtained as a byproduct during the photometric observations of our program star PV Cas for three years from 2011 to 2013. The light curves indicate characteristics of a typical W-subtype W UMa eclipsing system, displaying a flat bottom at primary eclipse and the O’Connell effect, rather than those of an Algol/ b Lyrae eclipsing variable classified by the northern sky variability survey (NSVS). A total of 35 times of minimum lights were determined from our observations (20 timings) and the SuperWASP measurements (15 ones). A period study with all the timings shows that the orbital period may vary in a sinusoidal manner with a period of about 5.6 yr and a small semiamplitude of about 0.008 day. The cyclical period variation can be interpreted as a light-time effect due to a tertiary body with a minimum mass of 0.71 M⊙. Simultaneous analysis of the multiband light curves using the 2003 version of the WilsonDevinney binary model shows that NSVS 1461538 is a genuine W-subtype W UMa contact binary with the hotter primary component being less massive and the system shows a low mass ratio of q(mc/mh)=3.51, a high orbital inclination of 88.7°, a moderate fill-out factor of 30 %, and a temperature difference of ΔT=412 K. The O’Connell effect can be similarly explained by cool spots on either the hotter primary star or the cool secondary star. A small third-light corresponding to about 5 % and 2 % of the total systemic light in the B and V bandpasses, respectively, supports the third-body hypothesis proposed by the period study. Preliminary absolute dimensions of the system were derived and used to look into its evolutionary status with other W UMa binaries in the mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. A possible evolution scenario of the system was also discussed in the context of the mass vs mass ratio diagram."

Other than the monochromatic ROTSE-I survey data, no multi-colored light curves (LC) have been published. Photometric data collected in three bandpasses (B, V and Ic) at UnderOak Observatory (UO) produced 5 new times-of-minimum for TYC 01963-0488-1 which were used to establish a linear ephemeris from the first Min I epoch (HJD0). No published radial velocity data are available for this system; however, since this W UMa binary undergoes very obvious total eclipses, Roche modeling yielded a well-constrained photometric value for q ( 0.25). There is a suggestion from the ROTSE-I data and new results herein that Max II is more variable than Max I. Therefore, Roche model fits for the TYC 01963-0488-1 LCs collected in 2015 were assessed with and without spots."

During 5 seasons from 2011 to 2015, photometric CCD observations were obtained mostly in the V passband, but also some in B and I passbands. The period was found to be 0.3881444 ± 0.0000006 day, which is not substantially different from the original period of 0.3881358 day. There were slight variations in the period from cycle to cycle and year to year, which are most likely due to asymmetry in the light curves caused by star spots. A preliminary model of the light curves indicates the mass ratio may be about 0.67, inclination 70.8°, and fillout factor 0.11. As no spectra are available, the range in B-V and V-I color indices of 0.8-0.87 and 0.87-0.92, respectively, were used to estimate the effective temperatures for the modelling, based on the spectral types of K0-K2. The spectral type may be earlier, if the color indices are affected by interstellar reddening.

Five new times of minimum light were calculated, along with two minima determined from archived All Sky Automated Survey observations. From these minima and the discovery epoch, a quadratic ephemeris was determined. Thus, a magnetic braking scenario is possible. Both semidetached and contact models were explored. A marginal contact solution had the best sum of square residuals. It gave a mass ratio of ∼0.5, and a component temperature difference of ∼360 K, albeit somewhat large for a contact binary. Two substantial cool spots were determined in this solution with 37° and 28° radii and t-factors or 0.94 and 0.78 respectively. The fill-out is very shallow, ∼106%.

In the O-C diagram, a small-amplitude cyclic oscillation (A <SUB>3</SUB> = 0.00030 days and T <SUB>3</SUB> = 2.06 years) superimposed on a secular decreasing was found. The continuous decreasing may be a result from the mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one. With the long-term decreasing of the orbital period, this binary will evolve into a deeper contact system. Because the light curve is stable, the cyclic variation is plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect (LTTE) due to the presence of an additional body. The mass of the companion is {M}<SUB>3</SUB>\\sin i<SUP>\\prime</SUP> =0.036(+/- 0.003) {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. If the orbital plane inclination is a random distribution, it is a brown dwarf with 66.7% probability. Therefore, the companion of V2284 Cyg is possibly the first candidate of the brown dwarf orbiting around contact binary, where both component are sharing a common convective envelope."

      "abstract": "New CCD photometric BVRI observations of the puzzling W UMa type binary star, TZ Bootis, are presented from our observations in 2010. By using the updated version of the Wilson-Devinney code, the first modern photometric solution is deduced from new photometric observations and published spectroscopic data. This low mass ratio binary turns out to be a deep overcontact system with f = 52% of A-subtype. A spot model has been applied to fit the particular features of light curves. Based on our seven new light minimum times and all others compiled from the literature over 70 yr, we studied the orbital period from the O-C curve. It is found that a 31.2 yr cyclic variation exists with an amplitude of 0.033 days, overlaying a secular decrease at a rate of dP/dt = -2.1 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The cyclic period change may indicate that TZ Boo is a triple or a quadruple system as confirmed from the published spectroscopic data. The long-term orbital period decrease is interpreted by mass transfer from the more to the less massive component and/or angular momentum loss by the magnetic breaking which would cause the overcontact degree to increase and finally the binary will evolve into a single rapidly rotating star."

The Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code was used to analyze those {{BVR}}<SUB>c</SUB>{I}<SUB>c</SUB> light curves, and the photometric solutions of this eclipsing binary were derived for the first time. It was discovered that V2787 Ori is a shallow-contact, total-eclipsing binary with a factor of f = 0.181(±0.077) and an extremely low mass ratio of q = 0.120(±0.002). The primary contributes about 95% luminosity to the total system, and the temperature difference between the two components exceeds 1600 K. This target may be the smallest mass ratio B-subtype system, but it definitely is among the smallest mass ratio B-subtype systems. The temperature of the secondary is determined as 5413 K, while its mass is estimated as {M}<SUB>2</SUB>=0.17(+/- 0.01){M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. These properties indicate that the binary may undergo a special evolution where the secondary may be the original more massive component and has transferred most of its mass to its companion. We combined our newly determined eclipse times with those collected from the previous literature, and found that the O - C curve of the binary system shows a cyclic variation with an amplitude of 0.0054 days and a period of 17.3 years, which is explained as the result of the light-time effect, due to a third body orbiting around the central binary. The minimal mass of the third body is 0.208 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and the corresponding orbital radius is about 7.24 au. The shallow-contact configuration, the extremely low mass ratio, the evolved components, and the presence of a tertiary component, all make the B-subtype Am-type contact binary a significant target for further investigations."

By analyzing all these light curves together with the Sloan g‧i‧ light curves observed by Kjurkchieva et al., we determined that both systems are W-subtype contact binaries and that V789 Her is a medium contact system, while V1007 Cas is a shallow contact system. Because the two binaries show totally eclipsing primary minima, the photometric results are reliable. In addition, the light curves of the two systems are asymmetric, requiring a dark spot on the primary or the secondary component in the modeling. By compiling all available times of minimum light including literatures, SuperWASP archive and ours, we analyzed the orbital period variations. We derived that the O - C diagram of V789 Her displays a periodic oscillation whose period and amplitude are 29.2 years and 0.0179 days and the period of V1007 Cas exhibits a continuous decrease at dP/dt = -1.78(±0.09) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The cyclic period modulation of V789 Her is probably attributed to the light travel time effect via a tertiary companion with very small mass. The continuous period decrease of V1007 Cas may result from the mass transfer between the two components. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of angular momentum loss because V1007 Cas shows strong magnetic activity. By analyzing the evolutionary status of the components of the two systems, we determined that they exhibit typical characteristics of other W-subtype contact binaries."

The absolute parameters of the two binaries were estimated according to their Gaia distances and our derived photometric solution results.

The photometric solutions reveal that V1197 Her is a W-subtype shallow contact binary system with a mass ratio of q = 2.61 and a fill-out factor of f = 15.7%. The temperature difference between the primary star and secondary star is only 140 K in spite of the low degree of contact, which means that V1197 Her is not only in geometrical contact configuration but is also already under thermal contact status. The orbital inclination of V1197 Her is as high as i = 82.7°, and the primary star is completely eclipsed at the primary minimum. The totally eclipsing characteristic implies that the determined physical parameters are highly reliable. The masses, radii and luminosities of the primary star (star 1) and secondary star (star 2) are estimated to be M<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.30(1) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, M<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.77(2) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, R<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.54(1) R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, R<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.83(1) R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, L<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.18(1) L<SUB>⊙</SUB> and L<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.38(1) L<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

      "abstract": "CCD, BVRI primary light curves of V1187 Her were taken in 2017 May and 2018 May at the Dark Sky Observatory in North Carolina with the 0.81-m reflector of Appalachian State University. A spectrum was taken earlier at Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) with the 1.8 m telescope. The spectral type is F(8.5 ± 1)V, resulting in a surface temperature of 6250 ± 125 K (Cox 2000), so solar-type activity is expected. V1187 Her was previously identified as a low-amplitude, short-period, over-contact eclipsing binary (EW) with an orbital period of 0.310726 d. Strikingly, despite its low amplitude (∼0.15 mag), the early light curves show a total eclipse (eclipse duration: 31.5 minutes). This can only occur (in the absence of a strong third light) if the binary is an exceptionally extreme mass ratio binary, perhaps the most extreme known. Eight instances of minimum light were calculated. A 12-year period study reveals a secular period decrease in the orbital period with good confidence. The rate of period change is dP/dt = -1.5 × 10<SUP>-07</SUP> d/yr, probably due to magnetic braking. Its Roche Lobe fill-out is found to be a hefty 84% along with a mass ratio of only ∼0.044 indeed, the most extreme known among solar-type (i.e., W UMa) binaries. It has a cool spot region. The secondary component has a temperature of ≈ 6680 K, which makes it a W-subtype binary (the less massive component is hotter). The inclination is only ∼67° despite its total eclipses. A q-search was conducted, which showed the 0.044 value was the best fit to the light curves. Additionally, follow-up observations were taken on 2018 May 4, which confirmed the mass ratio found from the earlier curves."

When comparing the light curves in 2007 and 2008, it is found that there appears to be an O'Connell effect in the light curves of 2008. From those observations, two sets of photometric solutions were deduced using the 2003 version of the W-D program. The results indicated that V345 Gem is a low mass ratio overcontact binary with f = 72.9%(±3.1%). The asymmetric light curves in 2008 may be attributed to the activity of starspot, whose area is up to 1.55% of the area of the more massive component. The contributions of the third light to the total light are approximately 20% in the BVR bands. The absolute physical parameters for V345 Gem were obtained first. From the log L-log M diagram of the binary-star evolution, the primary component is an evolved star. From the O-C curve for V345 Gem, it is discovered that there exists a long-term period increase with a cyclic variation. The period and amplitude of the cyclic variation are P <SUB>3</SUB> = 646.7(±0.7) day and A = 0fd0019(±0fd0002), which may be caused by the light-time effect via the assumed third body.

The kind of additional component may remove angular momentum from the central system, which may play an important role for the formation and evolution of the binary. The secular period increases at a rate of dP/dt = +5.88 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating that the mass transfers from the less massive component to the more massive component.

It is discovered that UZ CMi is a contact binary (f = 38.4(± 2.3)%) with a mass ratio of 0.45.

We found that the general trend of the observed minus calculated (O - C) curve shows a downward parabolic variation that corresponds to a long-term decrease in the orbital period with a rate of dP/dt = -1.96(0.46) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The long-term period decrease could be explained by mass transfer from the more-massive component to the less-massive one. By combining our photometric solutions with data from Gaia DR2, absolute parameters were derived as M <SUB>1</SUB> = 1.20 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, M <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.23 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>1</SUB> = 1.36 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and R <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.66 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The long-term period decrease and intermediate-contact configuration suggest that V1853 Ori will evolve into a high fill-out overcontact binary."

The photometric solutions reveal that the system is a W-type shallow-contact binary with a mass ratio of q = 1.335(±0.005) and a degree of contact of about f = 3.5(±1.1)%. In general, the results are in good agreement with what is reported by Samec. Dramatic manifestations of the O'Connell effect that appear in the light curves can be explained well by employing starspots on the binary surface, which confirms that the system is active at present. Several new times of light minimum were obtained. All the available times of light minimum were collected, along with the recalculated and newly obtained values. Applying a least-squares method to the constructed O — C diagram, a new ephemeris is derived for V1799 Ori. The orbital period is found to show a continuous weak increase at a rate of 1.8(±0.6) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The extremely shallow contact, together with the period increase, suggests that the binary may be at a critical stage predicted by thermal relaxation oscillation theory."

By using all available times of minimum light, the orbital period variation is studied for the first time. We found that the orbital period has varied by a combination of an downward parabola and a sinusoid. The downward parabola means continuous period decrease at a rate of dP/dt=3.66×10<SUP>-7</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and may be caused by angular momentum loss via stellar wind. The sinusoidal variation with a period of 12.8 yr and a semi-amplitude of 0.0064 days can most likely be interpreted as the light travel time effect due to the existence of an unseen tertiary companion."

Light curve synthesis with the Wilson-Devinney code gives a new solution, which is quite different from the previous study: UY UMa is an A-subtype over-contact binary with a small mass ratio of q = 0.21, a high inclination of 81°.4, a small temperature difference of ΔT = 18°, a large fill-out factor of f = 0.61, and a third light of approximately 10% of the total systemic light. The absolute dimensions were newly determined. Seventeen new times of minimum light have been calculated from our observations. The period study indicates that the orbital period has intricately varied in a secular period increase in which two cyclical terms with periods of 12y.0 and 46y.3 are superposed. The secular period increase was interpreted to be due to a conservative mass transfer of 2.68 × 10–8 M⊙/yr from the less massive to the more massive star. The cyclical components are discussed in terms of double-light time contributions from two additional bound stars. The statistical relations of Yang &amp; Qian (2015) among the physical parameters of 45 deep, low mass ratio contact binaries were revisited by using the physical parameters of UY UMa and 25 Kepler contact binaries provided by Şenavci et al.

The results indicate that this system is a totally eclipsing A-subtype overcontact binary with both a high fill-out factor of 76% and a third light source contributing 12% light in the B bandpass, 10% in V, and 7% in R. The light residuals between observations and theoretical models are satisfactorily fitted by adopting a magnetic cool spot on the more massive primary star. Including our 12 measurements, a total of 172 eclipse times were used for ephemeris computations. We found that the orbital period of UZ Leo has varied due to a periodic oscillation superposed on an upward parabolic variation. The observed period increase at a rate of +3.49× {10}<SUP>-7</SUP> day yr<SUP>-1</SUP> can be plausibly explained by some combination of non-conservative mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component and angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking.

The uniqueness of the solution is studied by starting several sets of differential correction iterations with different values of the main adjustable parameters. The short duration of the total eclipse at secondary minima makes the observations easily fit synthetic light curves with partial eclipses. In this way, three different solutions are found. When the configurations are forced to represent total occultations a single solution is obtained. The results are given in the form of two independent and convergent solutions.

It is an eclipsing binary with a period of 0.41283 d. The light curves yield a total eclipse (duration: 59 minutes) but have an amplitude of only 0.4 mag. The spectral type is G8V ( 5500 K). Four times of minimum light were calculated, all primary eclipses, from our present observations. We calculated linear and quadratic ephemerides from all available times of minimum light. A 17-year period study reveals a quadratic orbital period decrease at a high level of confidence. The orbital period is changing at a rapid rate of of dp / dt = -1.73 x 10-6 d/yr. The solution is that of an Extreme Mass Ratio Binary. The mass ratio is found to be near 0.16. Its Roche Lobe fill-out is a hefty 83%. The small component has the slightly hotter temperature of 5650 K, which makes it a W-type W UMa Binary. As expected in binaries of this spectral type, it has cool spot regions."

      "abstract": "Combining all available photometric data from various surveys and literature with our observations, we present 10 sets of light curves for the eclipsing binary V0599 Aur covering a timescale of 20 yr. During the last two decades, the O'Connell effect continuously varied and went through at least two flips between positive and negative effects. The photometric solutions from our two sets of multicolored light curves show that V0599 Aur is a W-type shallow contact binary with an active spot on the secondary. Its absolute parameters are determined by combining the Gaia distance with the photometric solutions. The period investigation reveals a secular decrease and a cyclic variation in its orbital period. The former mainly originates from the mass transfer from the more massive secondary to the less massive primary. The latter can be preferentially explained as a result of cyclic magnetic activity of the secondary, with three observational supports: (1) the existence and evolution of an active spot suggested by the long-term photometry, (2) periodic variation in both the O'Connell effect and relative luminosity, and (3) weak correlations between O'Connell effect/relative luminosity changes and cyclic period variation. Together with the cyclic period variation and its theoretical reasonability by Applegate's mechanism, we suggest that the secondary of V0599 Aur is a solar-type magnetic-activity star with an approximately 11 yr active cycle. Furthermore, by combining the secular period decrease with the Roche-lobe model, we infer that V0599 Aur is evolving from the marginal contact state controlled by thermal relaxation oscillation theory to the overcontact state."

The orbital period of V384 Ser showed an interesting cyclic variation overlaying a decreasing period, which may be caused by the light-time effect (LITE) of approximately 2.84 ± 0.01 yr or the magnetic activity cycle of 2.83 ± 0.01 yr. For AQ Psc, we found cyclic variations in its period caused by the LITE either as a result of a tertiary companion or because of a magnetic activity cycle. We derived the cycle of the tertiary component of AQ Psc as 23.87 (±0.14) yr or a magnetic cycle of 44.08 (±1.15) yr.

Our four epochs of light minimum along with others compiled from the literature were used to revise the period and study the period change.

The derived mass ratio of q=0.06532+/-0.0002 suggests that it has the lowest mass ratio among overcontact binary systems. As the orbital period increases, the decrease of the mass ratio will cause it to evolve into a single rapidly rotating star when it meets the more familiar criterion that the orbital angular momentum be less than 3 times the total spin angular momentum. To understand the evolutionary state of the system, long-term photometric monitoring and spectroscopic observations will be required."

The light curves show many unusual behavioral features, including changing occultation depths, transit minima, and asymmetric maxima. The four sets of light curves have been separately analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney method. The results suggest a totally eclipsing contact configuration for the system. Over a surprisingly short time span of only 52 days, the dominant spot distortion phase jumped twice between phases 0.0 and 0.5. The light-curve variations can be interpreted by the presence of two cool spots on the massive component. Based on our analysis, it is further suggested that the peculiar behavioral patterns are probably caused by the presence of two permanent, active large spots separated in longitude by about 180°, whose locations remain almost unchanged throughout. Our study demonstrates that the system has been undergoing typical flip-flop activity. We therefore conclude that V410 Aur is a W UMa-type system exhibiting flip-flop activity."

The secular period decrease is determined to be {dP}/{dt}=-9.42 × {10}<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which can be explained by the existence of angular momentum loss from the binary system via a magnetic stellar wind. The cyclic oscillation, with a 3.44-yr period and a 0.0015-days amplitude, could be explained more plausibly by the magnetic activity, although the light-travel time effect as result of the present of a third component cannot be excluded. According to the three complete light curves, the intrinsic variations are obvious, particularly in the deepness at primary minimum and in the phase around 0.75. The light curve of V0474 Cam is symmetric observed in February 2016, then it become asymmetric in December 2016 and February 2017. The W-D program was adopted to investigate the multi-band light curves and the results indicate V0474 Cam is a W-subtype binary (the less massive component is hotter). A mass ratio of q = 3.230 was derived by analyzing the symmetric light curves observed at February in 2016. After accepting the results derived from the symmetric light curves as the references, other two sets of asymmetrical light curves can be well resolved through adding a cool spot on the more massive component."

The cyclic change, explained as the light-travel time effect, reveals the presence of a tertiary companion. The marginal contact configuration and the continuous period decrease both suggest that the system may be a newly formed contact binary."

From the new observations, six new times of minimum light were derived. The light curves were analyzed by using the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney program. It is found that the asymmetric light curves can be modeled by a hot spot on the secondary component. The degree of overcontact is 15.4%, implying that the system is a shallow-contact binary. Combining the new times of minimum light with the photoelectric and CCD data compiled from the database, we investigate its orbital period. The results show that the orbital period may be undergoing multiple changes: a long-term decrease at a rate of dP/dt=-(1.502+/- 0.063)× {{10}<SUP>-7</SUP>} days year<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a small periodic variation with a period of 24.27(±0.34) years. Since V508 Oph is an overcontact system and both components are late-type stars, we discuss the possible connection between the mass transfer, magnetic activity, the third body, and the orbital period changes."

Using the Binary Maker 3.0 and PHOEBE 0.31a softwares, the BVR light curves were analyzed and absolute parameters were determined. Our solutions show that the V700 Cyg is a W-type contact binary with mass ratio of q = 0.54 and the degree of overcontact is f = 17.9 % . The asymmetric light curves in the maxima are explained by one cool spot on the secondary component. The positions of both components of V700 Cyg are shown in H-R and M-L diagrams, which indicate that the more massive component may be evolved main sequence star. The orbital period of eclipsing binary V700 Cyg was analyzed based on all times of minima from 1994 to 2017 (including new eclipse times). Analysis of the O-C curve shows that the orbital period of V700 Cyg is decreasing at a rate of dP / dt = - 1.39 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP>dyr<SUP>-1</SUP> . This decreasing period can be interpreted by mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one. The cyclic variation in the O-C curve is probably due to the existence of a third body in the system with a period of 12.6 years and it can be probably a red dwarf."

The O- C diagram shows a quasi-sinusoidal form superimposed on a parabola. The parabolic variation, which indicates the secular increase of the orbital period of the system, was interpreted in terms of the combined effect of mass transfer between the components of the system and mass loss by a stellar wind from the system. The sinusoidal form of the orbital period variation was considered as an apparent change and interpreted in term of the light-time effect due to an unseen component in the system. We have also studied the nature of asymmetries and the intrinsic variability in the light curves of the system. The differences between light levels of both maxima (i.e. O'Connell effect) and minima are changing with time.

A period study covering 54 years of observation or nearly 77,000 revolutions reveals three distinct eras of constant period with two major jumps of +0.1 s and -0.3 s. The light curves show that the primary and secondary eclipse depths are _identical_ in V, and are nearly identical in B, R, and I, indicating that the components have nearly the same temperatures. Standard magnitudes were determined and a reddening estimate was made. A simultaneous solution of the four light curves was computing using the Wilson-Devinney synthetic light curve code. The solution indicates that the system consists of twin ~K4 stars in shallow contact with a fill-out factor of ~8%. A mass ratio of 1.000 was computed with a negligible temperature difference of only 6 K. Thus, based on our purely photometric solution, V803 Aql is made up of \"Siamese\" (contact) twin components.

      "abstract": "CCD photometric observations of the eclipsing contact binaries (EW type) V3 and V4 of the cluster NGC 2539 were made in the B and V bands using the 2m telescope at the IUCAA-Girawali Observatory in India. The light curves have been obtained and using the Wilson-Devinney code, the combined photometric solutions have been presented here. The photometric solutions have revealed that both V3 and V4 are W-type contact binary systems with mass ratios of 0.806 and 1.001 respectively. Revised orbital periods, absolute masses and radii of the components have been obtained. New ephemerides indicate that the orbital periods of the variables have not changed much during the time span of the observations from 2003 to 2009. The estimated absolute parameters for the two variables V3 and V4 are in close agreement with the field EW-type binaries (Gazeas &amp; Stepien 2008). The distance estimate for V3 is 1712±48 pc indicating that this could be a field star in the background of the cluster, while that for V4 is 1183±32 pc, suggesting it to be a possible member of the cluster. No third light is found in the systems."

      "abstract": "The Behlen observatory 0.76 m telescope CCD photometer is used to obtain 347 observations of the short period (P≃0<SUP>d</SUP>.4) eclipsing binary star V719 Her. The observations done withV andR bandpass filters were made on 6 nights in 1993. Previously published light elements and the present five timings of minimum provide a new epoch and a more accurate orbital period of 0.4009828 days. Our analyses show that the period of the system appears to decrease. We recommend future monitoring of the eclipse minima for this system. No published spectral classification for V719 Her exists. From the color,V-R=0.391, we estimate it to be about F5. The 1993 version of the Wilson Devinney model gave the photometric solutions. The adopted solution indicates that V719 Her is a W UMa type contact binary. The mass ratio,q=(m<SUB>2</SUB>/m<SUB>1</SUB>, where star 1 eclipse at the primary minimum)=0.296 suggests that V719 Her is a WUMa system with type-A (transit during primary eclipse) configuration. The secondary minimum shows a total eclipse. V719 Her with period less than 0.5 and spectral class F5, is probably a zero-age contact system. Since our photometric solution shows that the luminosity difference between the components is very large, we suspect that V719 Her is most likely a single line spectroscopic binary. We recommend spectroscopic study of this system."

These observations were done using V and R bandpass filters on 9 nights in 1992. Previously published light elements and the present eight determinations of eclipse timings are used to determine a new epoch and a more accurate orbital period of 0.7796587 days. The photometric observations and solutions which have been obtained with the 1993 version of the Wilson-Devinney model show that V508 Cyg is a W UMa type contact binary system. Analyses give two possible contact solutions of different mass ratios (q = m<SUB>2</SUB>/m<SUB>1</SUB>, where star 1 is eclipsed at the primary minimum). One with q =0.44 gives an A-type W UMa system configuration, while the other with q =1.19 gives a W-type W UMa system configuration. V508 Cyg does not have a spectral classification, however, based on the color (V-R =0.566 Schmidt 1991b), we estimate it to be US. Generally W UMa systems with spectral-type US have periods ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 days. The considerably longer period of V508 Cyg suggests that it may be an evolved contact system with case B mass transfer. Both solutions indicate that the two components have similar temperature and luminosities. It is suspected that this system may be a double lined spectroscopic binary. Therefore it is recommended that spectroscopic observations of V508 Cyg be obtained so that a unique mass ratio can be established."

Our present BVRcIc light curves with ample coverage were taken October and November 2013 and January 2014 with the Dark Sky Observatory 0.81-meter reflector of Appalachian State University. They reveal the early-type V530 And as a totally eclipsing shallow or critical contact solar-type binary rather than semidetached near-contact one. In our extended period study, over a 14.25-year interval, we find a continuously decreasing period. This fits the scenario of magnetic braking for solar-type binaries. The temperatures of the primary and secondary components are estimated at 6750 and 6030 K. The component temperature difference is large for a contact binary. The fill-out, however, is a mere 5% so it is near critical contact. The mass ratio, M2 / M1, was found to be 0.386. Two star spots, probably magnetic in origin, were determined. We suspect that the binary has recently achieved physical contact"

      "abstract": "A complete photometric analysis of BVRI photometry for the very short period W Ursae Majoris binary V743 Sagittarii is presented. Four epochs of minimum light were determined from observations made during two primary and two secondary eclipses. Corrected values of four previous timings are also given. The period study yielded an improved ephemeris. However, a large (~60,000 orbit) gap in the data precluded any definitive period analysis at this time. Standard magnitudes are reported. The light curves reveal that V743 Sgr is a G8-K0 spectral type W-type W UMa system with a 22 minute time of constant light in the primary minimum. The light curves have a prominent asymmetry occurring in the maximum at phase 0.25. It is 6% higher than the maximum at phase 0.75 in V magnitude. Our simultaneous light-curve solution yielded a component temperature difference of ~350 K, a mass ratio of ~0.31, and a fill-out of ~10%. A large polar cool star spot was calculated. Apparently, the system has rapidly changing spot activity. This is indicated by a comparison of our previously published 1989 curves with the present 1991 curves, which show a shallower primary eclipse and a reversal in the sense of the asymmetry in the maxima (phase 0.75 higher). This research was partially supported by a grant from NASA administered by the American Astronomical Society."

After a q-search, the lowest residual mass ratio was found to be 0.48 with a Roche-lobe fill-out of nearly 51%. Despite its rather high temperature, 7,300 K, two magnetic spots were modeled on the primary component, a 10° radius equatorial dark spot with a T-factor of 0.88 and a 23° radius near-polar hot spot of T-factor 1.10. The component temperature difference was only ~80 K. These parameters point to a mature, early type, W UMa binary."

      "abstract": "YZ Phe is a very short-period contact binary (Sp. = K2 V) with an orbital period of 0.2347 d near the short period limit (0.22 d). We present the complete light curves which photometric data were obtained from the 60 cm telescope of PROMPT-8 at CTIO in Chile during 2016 June to October and 2017 August. The photometric solutions were determined by using the Wilson &amp; Devinney code and the results reveal that YZ Phe is a W-subtype shallow contact binary (f∼ 10 , q = 2.635, or 1/q = 0.379 for W subtype) with rotational motion of a large hot spot on the more massive component, showing a strong O'Connell effect with variation of maxima in photometric time series at period of 4.20 yr and stellar cycle at period of 1.28 yr. By compiling all available eclipse times, the result shows a long-term period decrease at a rate of dP/dt = -2.64(±0.02) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> d yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, superimposed on a cyclic variation (A<SUB>3</SUB> = 0.0081 d and P<SUB>3</SUB> = 40.76 yr). This variation cannot be explained by the Applegate mechanism. Thus, the cyclic change may be interpreted as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a cool third body. Based on photometric solutions, the third light was detected as 2 of the total light in V and I bands. These results support the existence of a third body. The long-term period decrease can be explained by mass transfer from the more massive component (M_2 ∼ 0.74 M_{⊙ }) to the less massive one (M_1 ∼ 0.28 M_{⊙ }) or plus angular momentum loss (AML) via magnetic braking. With 1/q &lt; 0.4 and long-term period decrease, all factors suggest that YZ Phe is on the AML-controlled state and its fill-out factor will increase, as well as the system evolving into a deeper normal contact binary."

      "abstract": "The newly discovered short-period close binary star, XY LMi, has been monitored photometrically since 2006. Its light curves are typical EW-type light curves and show complete eclipses with durations of about 80 minutes. Photometric solutions were determined through an analysis of the complete B, V, R, and I light curves using the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney code. XY LMi is a high fill-out, extreme mass ratio overcontact binary system with a mass ratio of q = 0.148 and a fill-out factor of f = 74.1%, suggesting that it is in the late evolutionary stage of late-type tidal-locked binary stars. As observed in other overcontact binary stars, evidence for the presence of two dark spots on both components is given. Based on our 19 epochs of eclipse times, we found that the orbital period of the overcontact binary is decreasing continuously at a rate of dP/dt = -1.67 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which may be caused by mass transfer from the primary to the secondary and/or angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind. The decrease of the orbital period may result in the increase of the fill-out, and finally, it will evolve into a single rapid-rotation star when the fluid surface reaches the outer critical Roche lobe."

Despite the fact that VW Cephei is one of the most well-studied contact binaries in the literature, there is no fully consistent model available that can explain every observed property of this system. <BR /> Aims: Our aims are to obtain new spectra along with photometric measurements, to analyze what kind of changes may have happened in the system in the past two decades, and to propose new ideas for explaining them. <BR /> Methods: For the period analysis we determined ten new times of minima from our light curves, and constructed a new O-C diagram of the system. Radial velocities of the components were determined using the cross-correlation technique. The light curves and radial velocities were modeled simultaneously with the PHOEBE code. All observed spectra were compared to synthetic spectra and equivalent widths (EWs) of the Hα line were measured on their differences. <BR /> Results: We re-determine the physical parameters of the system according to our new light curve and spectral models. We confirm that the primary component is more active than the secondary, and there is a correlation between spottedness and the chromospheric activity. We propose that the flip-flop phenomenon occurring on the primary component could be a possible explanation of the observed nature of the activity. To explain the period variation of VW Cep, we test two previously suggested scenarios: the presence of a fourth body in the system, and the Applegate-mechanism caused by periodic magnetic activity. We conclude that although none of these mechanisms can be ruled out entirely, the available data suggest that mass transfer with a slowly decreasing rate provides the most likely explanation for the period variation of VW Cep."

Four new light minimum times of V410 Aur were derived from new observations. The photometric solution for V410 Aur was obtained for the first time, while the orbital elements for XY Boo (observed by Binnendijk in 1971) were reanalyzed by using the latest Wilson-Devinney code. The third light contributions to the total lights of the two binaries are obtained. The results reveal that both systems are A-subtype W UMa binaries with low mass ratios and deep degrees of overcontact (i.e., q<SUB>ph</SUB>=0.1428 and f=52.4% for V410 Aur, and q<SUB>ph</SUB>=0.1855 and f=55.9% for XY Boo). The photometric mass ratios of the two binaries are very consistent with the spectroscopic mass ratios. By combining the spectroscopic elements with our photometric solutions, the absolute photometric parameters for V410 Aur and XY Boo are (re)determined. Analyzing the orbital periods of the two binaries, it is discovered that their orbital periods show continuous period increases, suggesting that the systems are undergoing mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one through the inner Lagrangian point L<SUB>1</SUB>. This kind of binary, with a low mass ratio, a deep degree of overcontact, and a continuous period increase, may coalesce into a rapidly rotating single star due to tidal instability."

A new photometric analysis with the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney method confirmed that it is a shallow contact binary (f ~ 13.3%) with a high level of spot activity on the primary component. Combining new determined times of light minimum with the others published in the literature, the period change of the binary star is investigated. A periodic variation, with a period of 34.2 years and an amplitude of 0fd013, was discovered to be superimposed on a long-term period decrease (dP/dt = -8.8 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days year<SUP>-1</SUP>). Both the secular period decrease and the shallow contact configuration suggest that this binary system is at the beginning of contact phase. It is on the way to evolving into a normal overcontact phase via secular angular momentum loss and/or mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one. The period oscillation can be explained either by the light-time effect due to the presence of a third body or by magnetic activity. On the one hand, if it is caused by the light-time effect, the mass and the orbital radius of the additional body should be m <SUB>3</SUB> = 0.17 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and a <SUB>3</SUB> = 26.6 AU, respectively, when this body is coplanar to the orbit of the eclipsing pair.

In this case, the required variation of the quadrupole moment is calculated to be 9.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> g cm<SUP>2</SUP>."

      "abstract": "Photometric observations in g' and i' bands of the newly-discovered W UMa stars WISEJ004327.7+722407 and WISEJ234557.8+510456 are presented. The two targets are with shallow-contact configurations and their components are of G--K spectral type. We found that WISEJ004327.7+722407 is of A subtype while WISEJ234557.8+510456 is of W subtype. The different light levels at the quadratures were reproduced by cool spots on the bigger components. The procedure for calculation of the global parameters of eclipsing binaries by light curve solutions and GAIA distances was refined for stars with deep eclipses. The obtained global parameters reveal that at least one of the components of WISEJ004327.7+722407 and WISEJ234557.8+510456 is oversized, overluminous and too hot compared with an MS star with the same mass."

      "title": "WZ Cygni: A Marginal Contact Binary in a Triple System?",
      "abstract": "We present new multiband CCD photometry for WZ Cyg made on 22 nights in two observing seasons of 2007 and 2008. Our light-curve synthesis indicates that the system is in poor thermal contact with a fill-out factor of 4.8% and a temperature difference of 1447 K. Including our 40 timing measurements, a total of 371 times of minimum light spanning more than 112 yr were used for a period study. Detailed analysis of the O-C diagram showed that the orbital period has varied by a combination of an upward parabola and a sinusoid. The upward parabola means continuous period increase and indicates that some stellar masses are thermally transferred to the more massive primary star at a rate of about 5.80 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The sinusoidal variation with a period of 47.9 yr and a semi-amplitude of 0.008 days can most likely be interpreted as the light-travel-time effect due to the existence of a low-mass M-type tertiary companion with a projected mass of M <SUB>3</SUB>sin i <SUB>3</SUB> = 0.26 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. We examined the evolutionary status of WZ Cyg from the absolute dimensions of the eclipsing pair. It belongs to the marginal contact binary systems before the broken contact phase, consisting of a massive primary star with spectral type F4 and a secondary star with type K1."

      "abstract": "First Cousins V(RI)<SUB>C</SUB> light curves of the W UMa-type eclipsing variable star <ASTROBJ>V861 Herculis</ASTROBJ> are presented. The system was observed in 2000 and 2003. The light curves obtained at different epochs showed significant deviation from each other. The O'Connell effect was about Δ V = 0.05 mag in 2000 but it vanished in 2003 (except the night of February 22/23, 2003 when we observed a small O'Connell effect (Δ V = 0.02)). Further peculiarities of the light curves are also discussed. The light curves were solved with the Wilson-Devinney code and the spot parameters were determined. The system seems to be a W-type contact binary system with at least one active component. This is strongly supported by the fact that the system is brighter by 0.45 mag through an Hα filter than the MS stars with the same colour index in the open cluster NGC 7790. This deviation can be explained by chromospheric activity of one of the components. <P />Table 3 is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?/A+A/417/745"

      "title": "YY Canis Minoris: Contact or near contact system?",
      "abstract": "New V photoelectric observations of the eclipsing system YY CMi, obtained at La Silla, Chile, and Merate Observatory, Italy, are presented. New times of minima and ephemeris based on our observations are also given. The V light curve was analysed by using the WD code to derive the geometrical and physical parameters of the system. Since no spectroscopic mass ratio is available, the q-search method was applied to yield the preliminary range of the mass ratio in order to search for the final solution. First the unspotted solution was carried out by using the unperturbed parts of the light curve and applying the DC program of the WD code. The solution was performed by assuming contact (mode 3) and semi-detached (mode 4) configuration, since no classification of the system is possible from the shape of the light curve. The solution in mode 4 does not lead to an acceptable model, since the secondary was found to be slightly overcontact. Therefore the contact solution was finally adopted. Moreover the light curve peculiarities (Max II fainter than Max I and excess of light around the phase 0.32) were explained by assuming a cool and a hot spot on the surface of the secondary (cooler) component. The degree of contact is very small (f~ 3%) and the thermal contact is poor (T_1-T_2)~ 650 K. These results together with the high photometric mass ratio q~ 0.89 indicate that YY CMi is very probably a system at the beginning or the end of the contact phase. Based on observations partly made at the European Southern Observatory (ESO).

      "abstract": "We present new CCD observations of V879 Aql. Our data clearly show that this star, hitherto classified as a delta Scuti variable, is in fact an eclipsing binary system of the WUMa type. From the photometric point of view it belongs to subclass A. Analysis of the light curves with the Wilson-Devinney program indicates contact geometry, total eclipse, and mass ratio equal to 1.97. The smaller secondary is slightly hotter than the primary and the temperature difference amounts to about 90 K. As a result of a transformation to the standard system, we obtained V magnitudes and (V-I) color indices for 211 stars in the field of V879 Aql. Among them we found two new red variables."

      "title": "CCD Photometry and Preliminary Analysis of V865 Cygni",
      "abstract": "CCD images of the thirteenth magnitude variable V865 Cygni were taken on four consecutive nights in the summer of 1990. The 1.1-m Hall reflector telescope at Lowell Observatory was used in conjunction with an RCA CCD camera system. Four times of minimum light were determined and improved linear and quadratic ephemerides were calculated. A period study, spanning over a forty year interval, may indicate that the system is undergoing a continuous period increase of 5.4 X 10^-8 d/yr. In a conservative scenario, this would be an indication of a mass accretion by the primary, more massive, component. The V, R, I light curves formed by the first precision photometry to be obtained on V865 Cygni, show that it is an A-type W UMa system. However, the curves are somewhat incomplete since the maximum which follows the secondary eclipse was not covered. The first synthetic light curve solution of V865 Cygni is also presented. This solution reveals that V865 Cygni is a contact binary consisting of two G spectral type components with a fillout of 18% and a mass ratio of 0.45. The component temperature difference is only 110K. A substantial hot spot region of 34 degrees diameter is proposed to model the asymmetry in the light curves following the observed maximum. We suggest that the origins of this region may be attributed to fluid dynamics rather than to the usual magnetic activity which is prevalent in late-type systems like V865 Cygni. (SECTION: Stars)"
